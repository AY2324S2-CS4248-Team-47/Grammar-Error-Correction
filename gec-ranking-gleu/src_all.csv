"It is undoubtedly true that in today's modern world people commute to work mostly by their private vehicles.It seems more convenient to them to move on their own rather than tied to a public transport. It can be argued that public transport system has been loosing its popularity in many ways. People feel that they can get to their destinations on time if they drive their own car.It is true in many cases as public transport like buses,trains and trams have their own specific routes and stops.This may cause people in getting late to their particular destination. Secondly, public transport seems to be going expensive day by day which has reduced its popularity. People therefore find cars more affordable for them. In modern society cars have become more cheaper to buy,which in turn has helped people to have them. Moreover,many car finance companies have made it easy for every individual to purchase the car. In conclusion,i would say that due to recent advancements in society,there has been a considerable increase in the car ownership.It can therefore be<unk> easily that there will be no role of public transport in the future.</s>"

"We human beings are highly socialized creature in the world. Therefore, it is inevitable that we have to learn to be part of the society. Parents, in some cases, are mentors to children. However, considering the complexity of the society, I believe it better to learn in schools rather than from parents. First of all, there is no denying that parents may teach their children enormous fundamental living skills, on which their progeny count. Nevertheless, the skills are not diverse enough for children to deal with specific problems when living in a complex society. For example, one of my senior high school's classmate had encountered communication problem involved in the other's family. As a consequence, they never talk to each other since then. Following the previous paragraph, there will always be people of different living styles, attitudes, and beliefs in every aspect of one's life. Have we not lived and learned the skills in a group, especially in school, we will not be skilled before entering the society. The society as a whole is a place where both competition and cooperation take turn continuously influence every member. If we only live in our original family, parents will probably forgive us when we make mistakes. In contrast, living in a society is another story: people might blame, compete, or even hurt others no matter who you are. Learning in schools, however, provides valuable opportunity for children to learn not only from teachers, but also from relationships between peers, and as a result, proves the way for being independent in the future. In a nutshell, there is a great deal of knowledge needs to be gained for children in order to live in a society. School, a place with diverse students along with their attitudes towards lives, might be better than learning merely with the parents.</s>"

It was just a miracle - it had turned out that the band's manager was my good old friend Daniel and he asked me for help when he found out I was a big fan of the group.

Drama Club This kind of club will allow students to express their feelings in a non-<unk>ent manner, learn how to manage their reactions and develop creative talent. A drama club will make examining plays such as Shakespeares' more enjoyable than solely studying them will.

Cooking classes will helps students spend less money on eating out and they will start eating healthier because by making their own food they will be more aware of what they are eating.

"Many people believe that public transport will be replaced by private one in the nearest future. The main reason is the convenience of travelling by cars in comparison with using public transport. Apart from that, there are many other benefits in buying a car instead of using buses or underground every day. First of all, an automobile gives such a valuable thing as privacy. For example, driving a car we can wear whatever we want and listen to the music on any volume. If the car is large enough, it can be even a perfect place for sleep. Additionally, if we are eager to travel outside the town in order to have some rest from a hectic rhythm of life, it will be more comfortable for us to use our cars. Only our own vehicle can provide us with an opportunity to find any quiet and pleasant place outside the city. Public transport can take us just to certain locations. Thus, it is clear that private transport such as automobiles has plenty of advantages. On the other hand, we can stuck with different problems while travelling by car. For instance, staying in traffic jams always steals much our precious time. Car accidents are the typical reason for this phenomenon. It means that travelling by cars can even be more dangerous than using public transport. Generally, bus drivers are much more experienced than automobile ones, therefore, accidents caused by public transport happen quite rarely. This makes travelling by public transport much safer. Thus, I would argue that driving a car requires much attention and understanding that careless behaviour on the road can make a serious damage to other people. In conclusion, I believe that public transport will eventually lose its dominance due to the fact that all people want to be independent and travel on their own. </s>"

I would like to think that in the future we will explore more the universe and we will colonise other planets. Maybe by doing this we would be able to find other civilisations and exchange technologies with them. I'd like to think that we will find a method to travel through the universe at the higher speeds than the speed of light. I don't think that people will live forever in 50 years, but I hope that the life of our children will be better than ours. Hopefully, I have chances to be alive in 50 years, so maybe I will see the future with my own eyes.</s>"

"Learning many ideas and knowing detailed facts both are considered crucial for students education. Some people think that knowing fact is more easily and practicable. Nevertheless, others consider learning ideas and concept is the best way to confront many academic and real-life problems. In my view, l completely agree with the idea that it is important to students to learn idea and concept than learn facts. I would like to explain my reasons. First, learning facts can help students to solve one kind of problems that they may face. However, ideas and concepts give people competitive edge in dealing with other similar issues. For example, once I do n’t grasp an idea that my teacher have explained in class, but just remember facts. When I do my homework, I find the problem is different than the case discussed in the class. While, I go back to my textbook and try to realize ideas and concepts. I work out the problem easily. From this experience, I learn that I do not just remember facts, but try my best to understand ideas and concept. thus, I can solve many kinds of problem simply. Second, learning ideas and concepts support self-education greatly. Consequently, you can reach high academic levels. It is easy to know facts from people around you. However, learning ideas and concepts need more investigation and understanding many of the academic textbooks.. Nowadays, there are limited time for any teacher to cover all point in a certain subject. When, students catch the idea of any topic it will be easy to understand all issue related to it deeply. For instance, when I was in senior year in high school. I took physics class. It was massive materials on a specific issue, but I attempted my best to catch its notion that made me recognize any unmentioned points. In sum, absorbing ideas and facts is the most effective strategy. Not only do student learn more in their studying, but also they help students understanding many facts in our life better than any other ways. </s>"

"I think public transport has good prospect in the future according on following reasons. First, the trend of environmentally friendly has grown since the shortage awareness of fuel, taking public transport can decrease the air pollution by car, and more governments had build the public transport system including subway, buses etc. The transport in the city isn't inconvenient as years ago. The other is, travelling by car isn't convenient if you go to the famous resorts, most famous resorts lack of parking lots, travelers may spend hours to park. On the contary, people who take the public transport can more enjoy the travel because they don't waste vitality on driving.

"In many countries, it's consider that the relatives are the close family and the only people with an individual can be just the way he is. This point of view is based on, for example, that you shares an important bond with your family or that you know everything about some members, like your cousins and they know everything about you. Maybe, most of us have spent our childhood with our cousins and they were our best friends for ages. Siblings are another strong point to support this statement. It's usual to hear that this kind of bond is the strongest inside a family, because everybody thinks that siblings are the only ones whom you could rely on, despite not always it's true. I should talk in the third person because I don't have any brothers or sisters, but a close cousins. In my case, this role is played by them. On the other hand, we can find arguments against this statement. For example, the debate about the statement that you cannot choose your family, but your friends. Thus, it fits perfect for those people who have a bad relation with their families. They have to look for the needs provided by the family in other people with whom they can trust. In conclusion, from my point of view, it's true that is less probable to find negative feelings inside family, like<unk>, refuse or hate. So, if you tell a secret to your sister or your cousin, it's almost obvious that they aren't going to spread it. Even, if you look for a good advice, some members of your family could help you from the heart. But, family not always guarantees these functions neither friends. However, friends can be as a family and fulfil all this functions, too. Therefore, I only would like to remark that family not means relatives, but those people with whom you can feel as at home. That is, in any place suddenly you can find someone who could become in your most close relative. </s>"

"“Prison has long been the traditional punishment for people who commit crimes. Some people believe, however, that community service orders are more appropriate in some cases. When do you think that it is right to order people to work in the community to pay for their crimes?” In recent years, the most common punishment for criminals has been prison. There are certain people who believe community service orders are more adequate in some cases. People who break the law, should be ordered to work in community in order to pay for their misdeeds, when they have done a minor offence or if they have acted unintentionally. Community service orders are more appropriate than prison punishments when people have acted unintentionally. Sending criminals to prison is a serious<unk> for people that have made a mistake. Nobody is sinless and people should not be treated as serious as being sent to jail. For example, graffiti<unk> in Bulgaria are sent to prison for 4 years. This is unfair, because they do not do any harm to the environment nor to the society. It is better that they do a certain amount of community work, for example clean their graffiti, which will teach them how hard it is to clean graffiti, and thus, prevent them from making new ones. Working in the community is more adequate compared to sending people to prison when criminals have done a minor offence. Limiting people’s freedom because of minor, non-<unk>ful to the society crimes is inhumane. Everybody deserves freedom, despite its crimes. Although their misdeeds should not be tolerated, I believe that had better do some community work. This will help them understand their mistakes and prevent them in future. For example, in Bulgaria, people who lay down and relax on the grass in the park are sent to jail for 6 years, because they are considered “doing serious damage to the environment and preventing the park from further development”. Community service orders should be used when people have acted unintentionally and when they have<unk>d a minor offence, as this will help them realize their mistakes, without them being limited in freedom by being sent to prison.

The wasted time also should weight in, whether it is waiting for the trains, or waiting for the delayed buses, not to mention the longer time it takes compared to travelling in a car.

"Nowadays the type of transport that you use is a concerning matter of discussion. Public transport include buses, trains, and subway, however cars, bicycles, taxis are not forgotten. In the moment of choosing, very different aspects like ecological effects, the economic viability and even time uses, take part on the decision. Firstly, the car option is the best one in comfort, because you do not depend on a specific time to travel and modern cars have the best technology in equipment and facilities. Then public transport is not as comfortable as the previous one, because luckily you can find a place to sit and forget it if it is in the rush hour. By the other hand, traffic is the biggest trouble talking about transport, cars facilities are replaced by the need of punctuality and, depending on the city, the delays are a concerning point when we talk about travelling by bus or trains. However, the economic aspect is very important to consider when we talk about convenience, cars are the most expensive ones.

Both of them share superior, Hastings, who remains the ethically upstanding senior<unk> officer; zealous and suspicious, not being everyone's cup of tea. Even though being widely recognised for his<unk> ethical standards, he hides a drastic change in his personal circumstances.

"Dear Jo, I am so glad that you would like to come to my country. My country, Indonesia, is full of natural attraction. It is an archipelago, surely many spots of tourism here. Beach, island, culture, and culinary are the common interest to explore here. If you would like to see wonderful beach, you could come to Bali, Lo<unk>k, Sulawesi or I<unk> Jaya island. If I can say, beaches in those islands are more beautiful and natural than in Java island. You could travel by plane from Jakarta to Bali or by train from Jakarta to Surabaya, so you can take a plane from Surabaya to Bali. If you choose to travel by plane from Jakarta to Bali, the trip will be much shorter, spending only two hours. If you plan to enjoy your trip along fresh greeny landscape in Java island, you can travel by train. It needs almost 15 hours, but you could have the view of villages during the trip. Basically, I like to travel by train for enjoying the view along the railway track. Also, you can interact longer with other passengers especially native Indonesian, just in case you need to explore more about Indonesia as you would like to get temporary job here. Indonesian people are famous with their friendliness, so you could start a conversation with them to ask anything about Indonesia; they will answer your questions with pleasure. Here are few tips for starting conversation with Indonesian : Indonesian person will reply a smile with a smile, so you can start with it; not all Indonesian speaks English, but most students could speak English. I suggest you to choose college students, because they are more familiar with English, besides they will welcome you with pleasure to experience their English ability; when you are going to use public transportation, you could ask an information you need to the official employee in the station or to student for the same reason, not many Indonesian speak English. Bali is the most famous Indonesian island for foreign people, many of them even know Bali but not Indonesia. Lo<unk>k, Sumbawa, Sulawesi and I<unk> Jaya islands have very beautiful beaches as well.

"My most memorable learning experience to date was my marriage. My ex-husband taught me not to be involved with some kind of people by <unk> his behavior before commitment. During our dating he was very charming and attentive. We discussed about some sexist ideas that I don't agree with what the society demands on people and I noticed a little sexism of him, but I was fine with that because That can happen, but due to my profession he couldn't be like that for so long because I was in a man's shoes. He was very jealous but I thought it would fade away with time and with the gaining of the trust but it did not and ended up making me sick by the time passed. I learned that a man does anything to conquer a woman, he even does a lot of hateful things for him such as going to her home every night to stay together or to hang out, while later you find out that he hates going to places except his house. I learned a man says anything just to shut you up and not discuss just to have some love moments. He does not end an argument and give a position to understand your point, he thinks he is right and does not want to think about it. I also learned that men think in a different way from the women during the day. For example, while women think about millions things like what they want to do or have to do during the day, while men just do nto think about anything and can be like that for hours, just whith a blank mind. But in my opinion this should be an excuse to think something that women shouldn't know anything about. I also learned that is the mother that gives the principles and the direction of a man's mind, and depending on her he is going to be a sexist or not, he is going to help and be an honor man or not, he is going to be a good and caring father or not, he is going to be a responsible human being or not. A mother is very fundamental and the basis for the men principles and beliefs. Women do not <unk>e their importance for the future on their own homes. They teach the same things over and over again and do not rethink if those beliefs and actions are really right to help the world change and be a better world for everyone</s>"

"I'm 24 years old, so I belong to the previous generation, when family, school and life in general worked in a different way, from my point of view. I have a wonderful family, made up of my father, my mother and my two siblings (a sister and a brother), both older than me. I consider myself lucky because I know I can always count on them, and because they love me as much as I love them. However, this doesn't mean that my parents, especially when I was a child, always told me ""yes"" and made me do whatever I wanted to. On the contrary, I grow up with many ""no"", and I do not always agree with them in different situations. But they taught me all the important values and good manners, and I'm grateful to them for this. For nowadays I see around me kids who are pleased in everything by their parents: they buy them whatever they want, and behave as ""friends"". I believe that this's wrong, because by doing so they're not doing their well. Parents must be parents, and friends must be friends. This doesn't mean that parents should keep themselves distant from their son; on the contrary, a son should talk to his family, asking for advice or just to confront each other, because communication is at the base of relationships of every kind. I just think that each of us in our life plays a role, and that doing parents is not an easy job, but they should try to do their best.</s>"
"It is well known that an image is better than a thousand words and that may be the reason for the success of television in a recent survey as the most important invention of the last 100 years. However, this election could not be the wisest as there are other inventions more useful than television and with better future applications.

Nobody wants to dismiss the importance of television and its achievements. For more than 50 years it has been the main entertainment channel displacing others as radio, theater, cinema and, sadly, also books. In its first years television was also an important channel to culture (theater plays, classic films, etc.). Unfortunately, in the last years television has lost this educational focus. The Internet, on the other side, has became more and more popular not only for entertainment but also for business and today is almost impossible to find an activity in which the Internet doesn't play a major role. The Internet has also replaced television to watch films and TV shows, especially among young people who prefer to download and watch the videos instead of watching on the fixed schedule of TV.</s>"

"Due to the ever-increasing population<unk> with the climate change, food shortage has become a significant facing by many countries. Some assert that genetically modified technology can be applied to address this problem. This essay will argue that genetically modified food can be the way out of the problem of food deficit and this will be done by focusing on its environmental benefits and increasing food yield. Firstly, GM food can have a positive impact on the problem of food safety. It is well known that the GM food is <unk> with various resistance genes, such as pest disease resistance<unk>. This means that the food being more resistant to pests and agricultural diseases can<unk> the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers that can poison the water supply and pollute the environment. This reduction in the application of chemical materials can create a safer agricultural environment, ensuring food safety. Furthermore, GM food can also improve the production of crops. Due to the various new traits resulting from the GM technology, such as drought tolerance and salinity tolerance, GM food can ensure the food production in the period of drought. This could be important for food production, especially in developing countries. However, some may argue that it is also questionable whether GM food has a detrimental impact on human health. Actually, thousands of tests on GM food, before bring it into markets, have been proven that it is harmless to both the environment and human health. In conclusion, it is evident that GM food can increase food yields with the less use of chemicals. In views of this, it is reasonable to believe that GM food might be an ideal strategy to alleviate the problem of food shortage. However, because there are some disadvantages in GM technology which is being developed, it is also recommended that governments should give more importance to the management of GM food.</s>"

This means that they are between 20 and 30 years old. After studying our advertising options, it was found that two of them can be suitable for our purpose. One way is to put advertising on the internet and use social networks. On the other hand, we can set up stands in shopping malls. In order to obtain maximum benefit from this it will be helpful if we give away product samples. As I mentioned above, advertising campaign must be appropriate to the target market. I therefore feel justified in recommending that the campaign in shopping malls will be more effective for us.

"Military service is the military training which needs people have to join army or voluntary for a period of time. In Korean, people should completed military service at least 2 years. Similarly, people have to join it 1 year in Taiwan. It is a debate that should everyone have to complete military service when they reach 18 years old. With supporters maintaining that it is important for national security and make people maturity,whilst opponents claim that the military service have effects on study and should have freedom of choice. Firstly,every countries acquire<unk>ization must be protected by a stronger armed forces for national security. If the war or other dangerous threat the safety of country,they can not get help from other countries immediately. Therefore,people accept military service could be easier to protect their country. Especially some small population of country have policy that is people need join military service due to develop into a powerful country. Secondly, the important for people become maturity when they completed military service, which probably is a particular experience for 18 years old. In addition to have hard physical training and get different special skills,people also can improve personal quality in military service. Consequently,people could be more independent and strong,they seems to earlier become mature than other people who do not completed military service. In contrast, opponents of military service point out that study is the first vital thing for people who reach 18 years old. Military service mainly to improve physical,however study might be completed better in school at the age because it has professional teacher team and a good study atmosphere,people usually easier to concentrate on learning knowledge. For instance, some countries allowed people join military service after their all courses was finished.

Relatively some people unwilling join military service,people <unk> in a military service possibly enjoy it. Furthermore,it also can respect for right s of people,especially for women who do not can adapt the hard training.

"I enjoy watching Tennis in my couch, is weird that I haven't played Tennis because where I live we don't have that kind of sport, so I just can watch in my TV. But I hope one day go to a tournament, travel to Spain and watch my favourite player who is Rafael Nadal from Spain. Since the first time I watched him play, eight years ago was the same year that I started watch Tennis. I like how the players moved through the court and how the audience applaused them every time they won a point, although I'm not in the court I could feel the feeling of the game, it's really awesome. Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real. My advice would be that I you want to play Tennis just go ahead play it, not expect till others do it, because you can do that too. At the beginning it could be a little harsh, but is the same with many others sports when they start, so just keep in mind that you can play Tennis with the most talented players from the world overall.</s>"

"Although using your own car is betten for moving around the city, public transport has shown to be a good way for travelling lost distances with a low cost and, depending on its quality, also low budget. There is not probably a bright future for public transport if it doesn't develop as it should in the world we are living today; that is, if enterprises continue with their current already old-fashioned business model, for sure they will lose customers, and so, benefits and weight in the transportation world.

"Thanks for sharing! I really enjoyed reading your blog about shadowing students. I like the way you gave examples how you felt and how you would change your own lessons. I live in the Netherlands and at our school it’s the same. Our pupils have to sit for many hours a day, and they find it hard to sit still and to be silent. I also think that a lesson went well if they didn’t talk and did their work. However, when I was reading your article I felt ashamed due to the fact that when every teacher teaches the way I do it is logical that our students can’t be quiet and can’t sit without making a move. Moreover, when we as teachers have a study day, I get tired myself by sitting all day. Your key takeaway<unk> was shocking for me, the feeling of being a<unk> is dreadful. In my opinion I am very patient and willing to explain difficult topics over and over again. I really hope my students feel the same, otherwise I have to change my attitude! I get paid for being a teacher and, as I see it, it is my job to clarify and help my pupils to understand. Your experience gave me food for thought especially when you wrote that our pupils are sitting passively and listening during approximately 90 per cent of their classes. I am going to look at my lessons again to see if I can change those lessons and try to make my pupils active. I teach at<unk>beroeps level and I have already started to use some activities were they must use an Ipad and make pictures or short films.

However, I find it difficult to use activities every lesson because they are time consuming. Although the main reason that prevents me from using them are my colleagues. I don’t see them doing activities, it looks as if they are just doing their lessons and want to use a book and that is it.

"Travelling by public transport is expensive and uncomfortable. The trains and buses are not big enough. There is not enough space for your legs and you often do not get a seat. This will not be a problem if you travel only short distances, but on long journeys that will be very uncomfortable. Travelling with your personal car is much more comfortable. There is the possibility to set up your seat. It is your own decision when you get up, because there are no time boundaries. There are no times when you have to be at the bus stop. If you use public transport for long distances in a city, you will often change the bus. There is the risk that you would not get the connecting bus and so you are stressed. In conclusion travelling by car is the easiest and best way. I think that it is not possible to use public transport because there are no buses or trains. Maybe car sharing is an innovative alternative to public transport. Many people use their car alone. The most of the time they have free seats in their cars.

"The social debate between progress and traditions has been going on for centuries. Through our customs, we celebrate our past and keep our cultural heritage alive. But it is also because of these set of beliefs, mostly of religious origins, that some societies fail to evolve and respond to the ever-changing needs of all of their people. One of the main advantages of cutural practices is that they allow societies to maintain their identities and gain economic stability. In most Latin American countries, millenary practices such as silver<unk>ing, not only keep the region in touch with its heritage, but they have become the sole source of income for many communities. Nations like Mexico and Peru, with internationally recognized cuisines, have taken advantage of their culinary roots and boosted the production of locally grown foods, like chipotle peppers and <unk>a, to bring economic growth to their agriculture sectors. On the other hand, the greatest disadvantage of traditions, is that religious beliefs have kept these very same populations from social and human rights progress.<unk> marriage and<unk> rights are not recognized by the Costa<unk>n and most Latin governments, all because of the set of beliefs of a percentage of their community. In conclusion, traditions should be <unk> and kept alive for future generations. However, the safekeeping of these practices should never become a priority over the<unk> of the collective.

"Nowadays it is possible to listen to various types of music. What is the reason for making music necessary for us? Is national music more important than foreign music, which is heard all over the world? Taking acceptance the strength of music, it is hard to imagine human life without it.

"One intelligent person once said: 'The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.' I totally agree with this statement and, to my mind, people should travel a lot because our world is incredible. But there is one more question: travel by car or public transport? First of all, of course, travelling by car is much more convenient than, for example, by bus. You can drive wherever and whenever you want. Even just in cities, let it alone travelling at long distances. But, on the other hand, traffic jam or bad weather can make our trip inconvenient. Moreover, there are not many parking places in big cities. Secondly, travelling by public transport is much cheaper. Not all people can afford travelling by car every day so they choose public transport. Thirdly, we should take care of our environment! Cars pollute our air what leads to many diseases such as asthma, allergy and even cancer. Moreover, cars release poisonous exhaust fumes and chemicals into the air, which mix with the water in the clouds, and the polluted rain, which later falls, damages trees, lakes and buildings. So, my advice is to travel by bicycle (at least, use public transport) because it is environmentally friendly!</s>"

If you have to take a train, you have to reach the train station by walking, taking a taxi or taking a bus. Further, after you board off the train, you again have to find your way to your destination by either walking or using another mode of transport.

"In this essay I would like to highlight how a wide range of public transport can help people to save a bit of money and a lot of stressful hours stuck in the traffic jam. Firstly as everybody know the cost of the fuel is increasing more and more, adding to those the bill that own a car will bring, it became immediately clear that it is cheaper go around by public transport. Why then there still be so many people who prefer to drive their own car instead of seat comfortably on the train or on the tube reading their favorite book on their way to work? I would say that this is because the public transport are not so efficient as the should do. In my town for example, I have been Waiting for up to forty minutes before I could take a bus.

Secondly, the environment would improve its state indeed, as far as I can see the pollution caused by the traffic is ruining monuments and making the air dirty and heavy, the same is as far as waste of time is concerned, obviously the fewer cars are around the quicker you can get where you want.

"Nowadays, students have a lot of various form of education. They may not only learn in school but also through the Internet. It has both advantages and disadavantages. The main advantage of learning per Internet is time saving. When we attend a school we often waste time on buses which we may intend to studying. In case of Internet learning we can oneself set hours of learning. Also, possibility of learning at home is a big advantage, especially for people who prefer peace and silence. Then it's better to concentrate of learning and we don't feel any pressure or stress connected with asking and tests. On the other hand, through the Internet learning on a long term we could feel bored or lonely, School gives opportunity of learning in group when students may help each other and resolve problems. Another disadvantage of learning per Internet can be issue with Internet connection. It not always work correctly.</s>"

"Dear Sir: It is not an easy task to explain the importance of this exam for me, since I do not have any specific objective in mind that requires a Cambridge certification. Similarly, I do not have any study methods in the sense of systematic mechanisms to learn English. What I can say is that I have been learning English since I was twelve, and it has been a pleasure from the start. My first memory related to the English language is of lyrics; I love pop music and used to translate songs composed by Elton John and Lennon and McCartney. Next I started to read books such as the Harry Potter series and books by George R. R. Martin. I am also an attentive listener of BBC Radio Four. These are my study methods, if I can say so. About the reasons to take the test, there is little to say. As I have said, I have been learning English by the sheer pleasure of it; but, having come this far, I think it is time to get some kind of formal recognition about my level.</s>"
"Academic culture refers to the attitudes, values and that are shown by the people who work or study in universities. After I joined ACU (Australian Catholic University) I have found vast differences in teaching method between<unk> and Australia. In<unk> students study individually, do not ask questions with the tutor even if they are confused. Meanwhile, Australian education is based on making students learn new skills. Students need to have an active participation in discussion with their peers. Besides, students are able to raise questions with the lecturer because they can express their opinion. At first I felt difficult, stressed while studying in groups used to hesitate while sharing my ideas, opinion but now I am familiar with the academic culture. Academic culture is challenge for many students for effective learning. Peer learning is a small group of three to five students who are kept together to discuss the content and carry out educational activities in mutual engagement. (Fisher, as cited in Strake, 2010, p.2), Peer learning is a two way learning process in which members of group feel easier to discuss the content. It helps to know the importance of group work by giving and receiving feedback on particular tasks. According to Hamp <unk>, the goal of EAP (English For Academic Purpose) course is to teach students relevant study skills they need throughout their degree. It helps to share the ideas, knowledge, among the students and make them think critically, by using formal language while writing and so on. In conclusion, the adoption of Australian academic culture has developed strategies for my learning. I have become an independent learner and started to raise a question, share my opinion to the tutor. In the future I will enhance learning strategies by working actively in group. </s>"

"With no doubt all parents want their children to be citizen models. However raising a child into a model citizen is extremely hard - working. Some people think that this job should be done by the parents and others think unfairly that this is the teacher's responsibility. On one hand, parents should take responsibility on their children education as they are a child's first contact. Also, parents are like models to follow for their children, and as children do what they see they will copy their parents actions. Indeed school is the first place where a children interacts with society. However, they will talk or build a relationship based on what they see their parents doing with other people. Ultimately, teachers may have different values from the ones of the parents. On the other hand, parents may have lack of time to spend with their children due to demanding jobs and to provide everything that their children need, for example pay for their children school. It can also be argued that children spend most of their time at school and not at home, making the school responsibility to pass good social values. But it should not be forgotten, that parents have the most influence as they are models to follow. To sum up, parents should take full responsibility for their children education. However, one should take into account that a school with similar values to the ones of the parents would be a great help in the children raising process.</s>"

These things makes we think if the public transport has a future, after all to do all the things you need in your routine like to go to work, to go shopping or just to go out with the family, is more comfortable by car than by bus. Cars nowadays have technology that allow both drivers and passengers to have a better travel while listening to a music or use the internet without having to spend hours standing during the journey.

The car is a transport more comfortable than the public transport but is not sustainable, its cost is higuer and if all people move by car, The cities will be very pollutes. Also, in the big cities, the public transport is more punctual than the car because this transport usually has its own lane,while if you use the car,you takes more because there are a lot traffic in your lane. Other transport that can be very used in the future is the bike, this transport is cheap and ecological, also, more and more the cities are building a lot bike lane so is a good alternative. For travelling other cities or town, in my opinion, the car will remain the transport most used, although the new transports could change this situation. For the finish, I think that the transport most use in the cities in the future will be the bus, metro and bike and for travelling enter cities the car will remain the most used.</s>"

"Set in in the late<unk>s France, Cho<unk>t deals with the topic of society discriminating against different people because of their being different: whether they are gypsies, women that don’t depend on men, or people that don’t share the Christian faith. The plot revolves around Vianne<unk>r, a single mother and chocolate expert, opening a ‘cho<unk>terie’ right before Lent in a small, close-minded French village, the mayor of which decides to boycott her. During Lent, the protagonist gets to know other outcasts (mainly women) and help them. However, Vianne must learn to solve her own problems and change the course of her own life. One of the strengths of the film is its star-studded cast: Juli<unk> Bi<unk>e as Vianne,<unk> Molina as the mayor, Judi Dench as a grumpy, elder woman resented with the oppressing society of the village, and a young Johnny Depp as a handsome gypsy arriving in town with his<unk>. Each and every one of the roles is beautifully written and the actors don’t fail in bringing them to life. Besides the cast, I would like to highlight the original soundtrack. It adapts perfectly to the theme of the movie, with a little bit of jazz man<unk>, a popular genre amongst European gypsy communities, and reminiscences of Mexican folklore, as the recipes Vianne<unk>r prepares in the ‘cho<unk>terie’ are a heritage from her Maya ancestors. If I had to find a down side to Cho<unk>t, it would be that the film format does not allow us to have a deeper look into some of the characters and their storylines. Had it not been written in the year 2000, but today, I am sure that this story would have been turned into a successful TV series in which we could have learnt more about the past and the future of those fantastic characters. All in all, this is a gripping, moving, and entertaining film that will make you reflect on some social issues.

"I do agree television advertising direct toward young children should not bet allowed for several reasons. First, this kind of advertisement should be forbiden reasoning the fact young children are still strongly vulnerable. Kids around these age (2 to 5 years old) do not have a<unk>ated critical sense and anything can easyly persuade them. For instance, when I was three years old I used to be <unk>d for all the toys which were presented on tv commercials just because the way they were exposed. One of them was ""the ultimate<unk> steel"" which was about a hundred dollars. Secondly, I am also opposed the allowance of this advertisement because the severely consequence it causes into the parents and child's relationships. It is common we see parents having issues with their kids in reason to this kind of commercial. Many parents have an unhealthy relationship, or even a wrecked relationship, with their kids. One example is what happened with/to my cousin Patricia when she had her first child called Sophia. One day sophia got really excited with an advertisement about barbie doll and she could not think about anything else than having this toy. Unfortunately, my cousin did not have enough money to buy it, but her daughter - a three years old kid- did not understand it and got angry with Patricia, do not speaking well with her for three weeks! In conclusion, I am strongly favourable to this statement. Advertisement for young kids, not only until 5 but until 8 years old should be forbiden reasoning the kid's vulnerability and the risk to their parents' relationships with them. In last case, if the advertisements were still exposed, It would be essential some educational politics come with them, valorizing and teaching kids on understanding their parents.</s>"

"Hello Jane! Here is a picture from the last summer when we were in Halland on an island called Nidingen! My name is Lorin and I am 13 years old. I live in Djursholm at Riddarv<unk>gen 42, close to a field. I was born on August 4 at the hospital in Danderyd. In my family we are five people, my mom Malak, my dad Claes, my little sister Novalie and my little brother Edvard. Novalie is 10 years old and Edvard is 6 years old. In my spare time I like to be with friends and I do also play soccer, dance and ski. I really like to do sports because I like to be outside. I compete in skiing and I think it's very funny. I often go skiing in <unk> re, Vemdalen and in Ramundberget. Once every year I ski with my ski club (T<unk>by slalomklubb) in Switzerland. In Switzerland we have been to Saas fee and Zermatt. In Zermatt you can see the mountain<unk>horn (the mountain that you see on toblerone package). It is a very cool mountain. I do also ski with my family and that is the best. I like slalom because it goes fast and I like snow. In the summer holidays my family and I just to be at the vest seaside on a small island called K<unk> lhuvudet. That is one of our summerhouses I love to be there because when we are there we swim in the ocean and we fish crabs and just have a really fun. You can of course see the ocean and it is very beautiful. Something else I like to do is shopping. My parents call me a shopaholic and I almost agree. I like it because it is fun to look at clothes and try them. I read pretty much and my favourite book is Harry Potter. I like fantasy and that book is fantastic. If it was possible to go on Hogwarts I would do it. Now you know what my favourite book is so you can almost guess what my favorite movie is... Of course Harry Potter.

"There is no doubt that travelling by car is the most comfortable option, but claiming that public transport has no future is too much. Many people use public transport on a daily basis. There are people who wouldn't be able to travel if it wasn't for public transport. Children and elders can't have a driving license, so if they need to go somewhere, using public transport is their only option. Travelling by car is also very detrimental for the environment. In big cities, the air is very polluted because there are too many cars. Travelling by public transport lowers the impact on the environment, something that most people are aware of, but still they prefer to use their own vehicle. Using public transport can also save time, since you don't have to spend time looking for a place to park your car. I definitely think that public transport will continue to be very important in the future. </s>"
"One day Michael woke up from a strange dream, the dream was focused from a camera that was following a shadow in front of it. Everything was dark except for a ray of light that probably started at the end of that way. The shadow kept walking and running from what Michael supposed it was a threat. Michael was confused, he didn't know why he had dreamed that, he thought it would be better to forget about it so he stopped thinking about his dream. That day Michael had to go to work, so he woke up from his bed and went to his bathroom. When he was ready he took his keys and everything he needed, he locked the door and went to his job.

"Before focusing on the topic of technology itself, I would like to mention some aspects related to education. First of all, Spanish educational laws are in Europe, and probably in the world, the only ones which have changed the most in the last 30 years. This fact leads the teachers to be <unk> of what they are doing. Besides, there are no results that can be analysed or checked. Secondly, there are two sorts of schools in Spain-public and private-, which produces a big difference in the educational knowledge. While public ones must obey governmental laws strictly, private schools have some privileges. Knowing this about the Spanish education system, we can now talk about technology. I obviously agree that nowadays technology is necessary. So, the schools and the educational institutions in general have to update the way they teach. Technology does not imply a new instrument to be taught but a new tool and source of knowledge (if used correctly). In fact, using technology without changing the contents would be a total failure. Teachers must learn how to use these new technological devices in order to get their students motivated. Moreover, they should<unk> the past information and the new one. Thus, this would help students know how the world has evolved and how it will be. In other words, technology should be used as a tool for the students be aware of the development of society and its advantages and disadvantages. This new technologies also help in the teaching development. We can make dynamic classes by being in contact with other schools, in the case of subjects such as English and French, students would improve their skills by being in contact with students from different countries. Also, teachers could replace their<unk> following the best ones and the ones which contribute to have qualified students trained to face everyday life situations. In conclusion, as a great teacher said, we have 21st century students learning with 20th century tools the 19th century knowledge.

My favourite sport. Let me tell you about my favorite sport. I like many types of sports but I prefer swimming. Swimming is my favourite sport. I practise it every day in my school. We have a swimming pool in our school and we swim from 8a.m. to 10a.m. When I swim I feel very happy and relaxed. The benefits of swimming are that your body is healthy and your brain is alert. To practise this sport first you have to meet someone who teaches you how to swim because it is a beautiful sport but it is also dangerous.You have to have a good coach and a good swimsuit.If you try it you can do it.

"PLANE, TRAIN OR BOAT? Everyone likes something more or less, even when it comes to little things.

I'm not going to spend a lot of money for a ticket, because I'm studying so I just have a part-time job. If we check the prices of air travel, we can be disappointed as well as of travel by boat. Fortunately the train tickets are cheaper. Another very important thing is the travel time. Plane flies very quickly, but you have to be at the airport at least an hour earlier.

"This topic leads me to think of professional skill ""Architecture design"". This result in different of views on whether people agree the best things for improvement people's lives have already taken place. I hold the belief that the topic for me is completely wrong, even some improvements are easy to use and solves the most of problems. First, the development of population still continue, the space for living still a serious problem although, the skyscraper already solved the most of problems from population crisis. On the other hand, the skyscraper makes more problems, such as pollution. For example, I designed the highly architecture in the highly population density city in Taiwan. The skyscraper provides more space for excess population; however, the building will produces more pollution when the skyscraper constructs by modern materials, such as steel and concrete. They will destroy the environment when the raw material digs out from the site. The pollution must hurt the local people and environment from the site of raw materials. This is why I mentioned that the problem still exists and the problem only transforms to another regions and type. Second, the computer system looks like solves the most of problems; however, this system make more dangerous in specific situations. The ""BUG"" must be appears from man-made system because of the incomplete coding. That is why our personal information always leaks to the ""hacker"". For instance, when we enjoy the electronic commercial service and shop the goods on the Internet, the hacker may steal the private information at the same time. They will use that information to cheat people’s money on the phone and you will trust them because of the correct personal information. This is normal phenomenon in Taiwan; however, police can’t do anything because of the hacker's anonymity. That is what I said that the best improvement things still not exist, even the computer system already solved some problems. Of course, some people may be moved to disagree with my position on this issue. That being said, I still feel the reasons I have presented was strong ones, such as architecture and computer system. </s>"

The situation with household litter looks much better rather than what happens on the streets of the city. Waste is thrown on the ground and very few people are concerned about this problem. Town's actions As not all inhabitants are sensitive about the environment, it is the local government's responsibility to decrease the harmful effects of people's actions.

First, it is unnecessary to spend more money on school buses because by<unk> 5 children are able to take care of themselves and each other. They can communicate well and are aware of dangerous situations. For example, if they see drunk or dirty people on public buses, they could avoid sitting near them or report them to the bus driver. Second, it is a good opportunity to educate them in life skills such as knowing not to sit in priority seats or leave litter on the bus. In contrast, I think that the parents who insist their children should only travel on school buses protect them too much. In daily life, many youngsters need to go to school and back by public transportation. In other words, if parents spoil their offspring then they may become too dependent and incapable of<unk> well in society later on.

"""Atacama 33"" ""Atacama 33"" is a recent American movie that tells the real story of a group of miners that keep<unk> in a mine 700 metres underground in Chile for two months. This group had a leader called Mario Casas starring Antonio Banderas. The film is well-developed and shows the audience every little issue and difficulty that miners had to go through. However the first 17 days in the movie could turn a bit tedious because the director focused in every single feeling of the<unk> men and their families. After that lapse the rescuers found the place where the miners were hiding and the moment for rescue them started. The characters were perfect as soon as they were people from Chile and Bolivia that were involve with the real accident.

"There are many different types of music in the world today. Why do we need music? Is the traditional music of a country more important than the International music that is heard everywhere nowadays? Music is a special world. It has it's own rules, tools and the people who are specialized in it. Over decades music is the eternally art which develop day by day. We need music in most of our times or even every single day, to enrich our days with happiness and joy, and also to melt away sorrows or depression, that can affect us and prevent ourselves from doing the best.

"Nowadays the healthy habits of young people are very different than in the nineties. And we need to know the reason for these changes and what we can do to improve it. Firstly, it is true that the young people used to do sport daily in any where, at the school or in the street and also they didn't use to eat fast food. Secondly, many people argue that the society has experienced a great changes in the family life. Parents work outside the home all day. Although they want the best for their children sometimes is difficult because they are tired and they tend to prepare junk food and allow them to spend their time on the internet or playing with the game machine. In my opinion, parents should be concerned for their family's comfort and should motivate their children to do sport, be in contact with a lot of people and avoid eating fast food.</s>"
"In terms of holidays, some people like to visit their own countries, while others prefer going abroad. I think going abroad is much more exciting. Visiting their own country certainly has its advantages. First of all, you don't have to take very long trips. Also, you can have the opportunity to discover new places just next to your home. Besides, this type of vacation is usually less expensive than going abroad. On the other hand, many people prefer visiting other countries. Actually, they like the idea of visiting an unknown land, where everything is different, from the weather to the habits. Furthermore, they also like going abroad to visit important and famous cities around the world, like Paris, Madrid, New York. In my opinion, traveling to a foreign country makes people open their minds to other cultures. In fact, going abroad is a nice way to make new friends, try new things and improve a foreign language. In addition, if you plan your vacation very soon, you can also save money on planes or hotels. In conclusion, I think it's important to know both their own countries and foreign lands. </s>"

"here are many fields of study that have not been discovered or researched by humans. Many reasons cause the research hardly going on. As a result, there is the debate whether educational institutes have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing field of study in which they are unlikely to succeed. In my opinion, I agree with the statement with qualifications by following reasons. Admittedly, some of the research need to invest many resources that educational institutes cannot afford. Such research indeed will fail. Educational institutes should dissuade students. However, if there is not lack of the resource for the field of study, Educational institutes should support students for their study area. Education’s greatest purpose is to encourage student to attempt and learn from the fail. Take Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, for example. He tried a lot of different materials to make<unk> of the light bulb. Once, people think he would succeed. Even though the research really cannot succeed. Students can learn some things from the course of the research.

In addition, students in the course of research maybe create serendipity. Like Alexander<unk>rming Alexander, the inventor of the<unk>, discovered the Pen<unk> accidentally from the research of the germ. “You must do the thing you think you cannot do.” said by Eleanor<unk>.
