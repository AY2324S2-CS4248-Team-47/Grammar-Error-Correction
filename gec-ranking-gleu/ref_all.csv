Michael thought that he could use his father's car, and borrow some money from his mother.

"It is undoubtedly true that in today's modern world people commute to work mostly in their private vehicles. It seems more convenient to them to get around on their own rather than be tied to public transport. It can be argued that public transport systems have been losing their popularity in many ways. People feel that they can get to their destinations on time if they drive their own car. It is true in many cases, as public modes of transport like buses, trains and trams, have their own specific routes and stops. This may cause people to get to their particular destination late. Secondly, public transport seems to be getting more expensive day by day, which has reduced its popularity. People therefore find cars more affordable for them. In modern society, cars have become cheaper to buy, which in turn has helped people to have them. Moreover, many car finance companies have made it easy for every individual to purchase a car. In conclusion, I would say that, due to recent progress in society, there has been a considerable increase in car ownership. It can therefore easily be<unk> that there will be no role for public transport in the future.</s>"

"We human beings are highly socialized creatures in the world. Therefore, it is inevitable that we have to learn to be part of society. Parents, in some cases, are mentors to children. However, considering the complexity of society, I believe it is better to learn in schools rather than from parents. First of all, there is no denying that parents may teach their children enormous fundamental life skills on which their progeny count. Nevertheless, the skills are not diverse enough for children to deal with specific problems when living in a complex society. For example, one of my senior high school classmates encountered a communication problem in his family. As a consequence, they have never talked to each other since then. Following the previous paragraph, there will always be people with different lifestyles, attitudes, and beliefs in every aspect of one's life. If we have not lived and learned the skills in a group, especially in school, we will not be skilled before entering society. Society as a whole is a place where both competition and cooperation take turns to continuously influence every member. If we only live in our original family, parents will probably forgive us when we make mistakes. In contrast, living in a society is another story: people might blame, compete, or even hurt others, no matter who you are. Learning in schools, however, provides a valuable opportunity for children to learn not only from teachers, but also from relationships between peers, and as a result, p<unk> the way for being independent in the future. In a nutshell, there is a great deal of knowledge that needs to be acquired by children in order to live in society. School, a place with diverse students along with diverse attitudes towards life, might be better than merely learning with parents.</s>"

Drama Club This kind of club will allow students to express their feelings in a non-<unk>ent manner, learn how to manage their reactions and develop creative talent. A drama club will make examining plays such as Shakespeare's more enjoyable than solely studying them will. Cookery classes Cookery classes are very important because students here are young adults that need to have basic skills such as cooking in order to manage themselves and live an independent life. Cooking classes will help students spend less money on eating out and they will start eating more healthily because by making their own food they will be more aware of what they are eating.<unk> Classes ""Do it yourself"" classes improve practical skills.

"How to learn English It's proven that to learn a foreign language, you have to go abroad.

Of course, studying in a foreign country also has disadvantages. First, it costs a lot. Even though there are lots of different possibilities and scholarships, not everybody can afford them. Living abroad, even for a short time, could be very stressful and people can feel homesick. Despite that, there are more reasons to study abroad. It is a very useful experience in many ways.

"Many people believe that public transport will be replaced by private transport in the near future. The main reason is the convenience of travelling by car in comparison with using public transport. Apart from that, there are many other benefits to buying a car instead of using buses or the underground every day. First of all, a car gives such a valuable thing as privacy. For example, driving a car, we can wear whatever we want and listen to the music at any volume. If the car is large enough, it can even be a perfect place for sleep. Additionally, if we are eager to travel outside the town in order to have some rest from a hectic rhythm of life, it will be more comfortable for us to use our cars. Only our own vehicle can provide us with an opportunity to find a quiet and pleasant place outside the city. Public transport can take us only to certain locations. Thus, it is clear that private transport such as cars has plenty of advantages. On the other hand, we can encounter different problems while travelling by car. For instance, sitting in traffic jams always steals a lot of our precious time. Car accidents are the typical reason for this phenomenon. It means that travelling by car can even be more dangerous than using public transport. Generally, bus drivers are much more experienced than car drivers. Therefore, accidents caused by public transport happen quite rarely. This makes travelling by public transport much safer. Thus, I would argue that driving a car requires a lot of attention and understanding that careless behaviour on the road can do serious harm to other people. In conclusion, I believe that public transport will eventually lose its dominance due to the fact that all people want to be independent and travel on their own. </s>"

If this will also be the case in our future, then I think that today we underestimate our future. I am only sure about one thing: technologies will have a more important place in our lives. Maybe in 50 years people won't work as we do now, instead, we will only build robots. Maybe in 50 years we will find out how our brain works and we will be able to create an artificial intelligence system that will solve all our problems. I would like to think that in the future we will explore the universe more and we will colonise other planets. Maybe by doing this we will be able to find other civilisations and exchange technologies with them. I'd like to think that we will find a way to travel through the universe at higher speeds than the speed of light. I don't think that people will live forever in 50 years, but I hope that the life of our children will be better than ours. Hopefully, I have a chance of being alive in 50 years, so maybe I will see the future with my own eyes.</s>"

Every day they went to the sea to play and swim until the sun set. Once a day Sarah made a challenge to Michael about who could enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out of the other hole on the shore, but Michael was afraid.

"Learning many ideas and knowing detailed facts are both considered crucial for students' education. Some people think that knowing facts is easier and more practical. Nevertheless, others consider learning ideas and concepts to be the best way to deal with many academic and real-life problems. l completely agree with the idea that it is important for students to learn ideas and concepts rather than learn facts. I would like to explain my reasons. First, learning facts can help students to solve one kind of problem that they may face. However, ideas and concepts give people a competitive edge when dealing with other similar issues. For example, I don’t grasp an idea that my teacher has explained in class, but just remember the facts. When I do my homework, I find the problem is different than in the case discussed in the class. But, if I go back to my textbook and try to realize ideas and concepts, I work out the problem easily. From this experience, I learn that I should not just remember facts, but should try my best to understand ideas and concept. Thus, I can solve many kinds of problem simply. Second, learning ideas and concepts supports self-education significantly. Consequently, you can reach high academic levels. It is easy to find out facts from people around you. However, learning ideas and concepts needs more investigation and understanding from many of the academic textbooks. Nowadays, there is limited time for any teacher to cover all points on a certain subject. When students grasp the idea of any topic it will be easy to understand all issues related to it deeply. For instance, when I was in senior year in high school, I took physics class. There were masses of materials on a specific issue, but I tried my best to grasp <unk> and that made me recognize any unmentioned points. In summary, <unk> ideas and facts is the most effective strategy. Not only do students learn more in their studies, but also it helps students understand many facts in our lives better than any other way. </s>"

If all the people in a city use their own car at the same time, there will be a huge traffic jam, so travelling by car isn't much more convenient in this situation. There are more problems in big cities. One of them is parking.

In contrast, people who take public transport can enjoy the journey more because they don't waste energy on driving.

"In many countries, it's considered that relatives are the close family and the only people with whom an individual can be just the way he is. This point of view is based on, for example, the fact that you share an important bond with your family or that you know everything about some members, like your cousins and they know everything about you. Maybe most of us have spent our childhood with our cousins and they were our best friends for ages. Siblings are another strong point to support this statement. It's usual to hear that this kind of bond is the strongest inside a family, because everybody thinks that siblings are the only ones whom you can rely on, despite the fact that it's not always true. I should talk in the third person, because I don't have any brothers or sisters, but I do have close cousins. In my case, this role is played by them. On the other hand, we can find arguments against this statement. For example, the debate about the statement that you cannot choose your family, but you can choose your friends. Thus, it fits perfectly for those people who have a bad relationship with their families. They have to look for the needs provided by the family in other people whom they can trust. In conclusion, from my point of view, it's true that it is less probable to find negative feelings inside the family, like<unk>, <unk> or hate. So, if you tell a secret to your sister or your cousin, it's almost obvious that they aren't going to spread it. Even if you look for good advice, some members of your family could help you from the heart. But, family does not always guarantee these functions, and neither do friends. However, friends can be like a family and fulfil all these functions, too. Therefore, I would just like to remark that family does not mean relatives, but those people with whom you can feel at home. That is, in any place, suddenly you could find someone who could become your closest relative. </s>"

"“Prison has long been the traditional punishment for people who commit crimes. Some people believe, however, that community service orders are more appropriate in some cases. When do you think that it is right to order people to work in the community to pay for their crimes?” In recent years, the most common punishment for criminals has been prison. There are certain people who believe community service orders are more adequate in some cases. People who break the law, should be ordered to work in the community in order to pay for their misdeeds, when they have done a minor offence or if they have acted unintentionally. Community service orders are more appropriate than prison punishments when people have acted unintentionally. Sending criminals to prison is a serious<unk> for people that have made a mistake. Nobody is sinless and people should not be treated as seriously as being sent to jail. For example, graffiti<unk> in Bulgaria are sent to prison for 4 years. This is unfair, because they do not do any harm to the environment nor to society. It is better that they do a certain amount of community work, for example clean off their graffiti, which will teach them how hard it is to clean off graffiti, and thus, prevent them from making new graffiti. Working in the community is more appropriate compared to sending people to prison when criminals have committed a minor offence.<unk>ing people’s freedom because of minor, non-<unk>ful to the society crimes is inhumane. Everybody deserves freedom, despite their crimes. Although their misdeeds should not be tolerated, I believe that they had better do some community work. This will help them understand their mistakes and prevent them in future. For example, in Bulgaria, people who lie down and relax on the grass in the park are sent to jail for 6 years, because they are considered to be “doing serious damage to the environment and preventing the park from further development”. Community service orders should be used when people have acted unintentionally and when they have committed a minor offence, as this will help them realize their mistakes, without them being limited in freedom by being sent to prison. This will help them realize their mistakes and thus, quit making them. </s>"

Soon they can drive to wherever they want to go, and we also see people at the age of 80 still driving to their destinations as they are used to it.

"Nowadays the type of transport that you use is a concerning matter for discussion. Public transport includes buses, trains, and subway, but cars, bicycles, taxis are not forgotten. At the moment of choosing, very different aspects, like ecological effects, economic<unk>ability and even <unk>, take part in the decision. Firstly, the car option is the best one in terms of comfort, because you do not depend on a specific time to travel and modern cars have the best technology in equipment and facilities. Then public transport is not as comfortable as the former, because if you're lucky, you can find a place to sit and forget it if it is in the rush hour. On the other hand, traffic is the biggest problem when talking about transport, the car's conveniences are replaced by the need for punctuality and, depending on the city, delays are a concerning point when we talk about travelling by bus or train. However, the economic aspect is very important to consider when we talk about convenience. Cars are the most expensive mode of transport. Not only because of oil prices, but also the costs of insurance, the car, the parking fees, etc. In comparison with a bus ticket that costs four pesos and you are sure that sooner or later it will come.

"Dear Jo, I am so glad that you would like to come to my country. My country, Indonesia, is full of natural attractions. It is an archipelago, so there are definitely many tourist spots here.

If you would like to see wonderful beaches, you should come to Bali, Lo<unk>k, Sulawesi or I<unk> Jaya island. <unk>, the beaches on those islands are more beautiful and natural than in Java. You could travel by plane from Jakarta to Bali or by train from Jakarta to Surabaya, so you can take a plane from Surabaya to Bali.

If you plan to enjoy your trip amongst the fresh green landscape of Java island, you should travel by train. It takes almost 15 hours, but you can have views of villages during the trip. Basically, I like to travel by train to enjoy the view along the railway track. Also, you can interact for longer with other passengers, especially native Indonesians, just in case you need to find out more about Indonesia as you would like to get a temporary job here. Indonesian people are famous for their friendliness, so you could start a conversation with them to ask anything about Indonesia; they will answer your questions with pleasure. Here are a few tips for starting a conversation with Indonesians: an Indonesian person will respond to a smile with a smile, so you can start with that. Not all Indonesians speak English, but most students can speak English. I suggest you choose college students, because they are more familiar with English. Besides, they will welcome you with pleasure to practise their English skills. When you use public transportation, you can ask for the information you need from the official employee in the station or from students for the same reason; not many Indonesians speak English.

During our courtship he was very charming and attentive. We discussed some sexist ideas that I don't agree with about what society demands of people and I noticed a little sexism in him, but I was fine with that because that can happen.

He was very jealous, but I thought it would fade away with time and with the gaining of trust, but it did not and ended up making me sick as the time passed. I learned that a man does anything to conquer a woman. He even does a lot of hateful things for him, such as going to her home every night to be together or to hang out, while later you find out that he hates going to places except his house. I learned a man says anything just to shut you up and not discuss things, just to have some love moments. He does not end an argument and give a position to understand your point, he thinks he is right and does not want to think about it. I also learned that men think in a different way from women during the day. For example, while women think about millions of things like what they want to do or have to do during the day, men just do not think about anything and can be like that for hours, just with a blank mind. But, in my opinion, this should be an excuse to think something that women shouldn't know anything about. I also learned that it is the mother that gives the principles and the direction of a man's mind, and depending on her, he is going to be a sexist or not, he is going to help and be an honorable man or not, he is going to be a good and caring father or not, he is going to be a responsible human being or not.

"Due to the ever-increasing population<unk> with climate change, food shortages have become a significant problem facing many countries. Some assert that genetically modified food technology could be applied to address this problem. This essay will argue that genetically modified food could be the way out of the problem of food deficit and this will be done by focusing on its environmental benefits and increased food yield. Firstly, GM food can have a positive impact on the problem of food safety. It is well known that GM food is <unk> with various resistance genes, such as pest disease resistance genes. This means that the food, being more resistant to pests and agricultural diseases, we can<unk> the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers that can poison the water supply and pollute the environment. This reduction in the application of chemical products can create a safer agricultural environment, ensuring food safety. Furthermore, GM food can also improve the production of crops. Due to the various new traits resulting from the GM technology, such as drought tolerance and salinity tolerance, GM food can ensure food production in a period of drought. This could be important for food production, especially in developing countries. However, some may argue that it is also questionable whether GM food has a detrimental impact on human health. Actually, thousands of tests on GM food, before bringing it onto the markets, have proven that it is harmless to both the environment and human health. In conclusion, it is evident that GM food can increase food yields with a reduced use of chemicals. In view of this, it is reasonable to believe that GM food might be an ideal strategy to alleviate the problem of food shortages. However, because there are some disadvantages to the GM technology which is being developed, it is also recommended that governments should give more importance to the management of GM food.</s>"

In order to obtain maximum benefit from this, it will be helpful if we give away product samples. As I mentioned above, the advertising campaign must be appropriate to the target market.

"Military service is military training which means people have to join the army or voluntary service for a period of time. In Korea, people have to do military service for at least 2 years. Similarly, people have to do it for 1 year in Taiwan. There is debate about whether everyone should have to do military service when they reach 18 years old, with supporters maintaining that it is important for national security and makes people mature,w<unk> opponents claim that military service has effects on people's studies and people should have freedom of choice. Firstly, every country requires stability and must be protected by strong armed forces for national security. If a war or other danger threatens the safety of a country they cannot get help from other countries immediately. Therefore,people accept that military service could be an easier way to protect their country. In particular, some countries with small populations have a policy that people need to do military service to develop into a powerful country. Secondly, it is important for people to become mature when they complete military service, which probably is a particular experience at 18 years old. In addition to having hard physical training and getting different special skills,people also can improve their personal qualities through military service. Consequently,people could be more independent and strong. They seem to become mature earlier than other people who do not do military service. In contrast, opponents of military service point out that education is the first vital thing for people who reach 18 years old. Military service mainly improves physical fitness,but education might be completed better in school at that age because it has a professional teacher team and a good study atmosphere,people usually find it easier to concentrate on learning knowledge. For instance, some countries allow people to do military service after all their courses have finished. Additionally, critics argue that countries are able to allow people to have freedom of choice about military service. Some people are unwilling to do military service,while some people volunteer for military service and possibly enjoy it. Furthermore,it also can respect rights of people,especially women who are not able to adapt to the hard training. In conclusion, it can be concluded that military service is necessary for national security and good for people to improve themselves. The best course of action would be for government to attempt to allow people to volunteer for it when they have completed their studies. </s>"

"I enjoy watching tennis on my couch. It isn't weird that I haven't played tennis, because where I live we don't have that kind of sport, so I can only watch on my TV. But I hope one day to go to a tournament, travel to Spain and watch my favourite player, who is Rafael Nadal from Spain. The first time I watched him play eight years ago was the same year that I started watching tennis. I like how the players move around the court and how the audience applauds them every time they win a point. Although I'm not on the court, I can feel the feeling of the game. It's really awesome. Once in a while, I enjoy watching tennis when there is a competition or tournament, besides watching and enjoying it, I can also learn how real the game is, what its rules were or what happens when they yell at the umpire for no reason. You can learn all these details and wait for a future day to put them into practice, or helping the players is one of the things that I want to make real. My advice would be that if you want to play tennis, you should just go ahead and play it, not wait till others do it, because you can do that too. At the beginning, it could be a little hard, but that is the same with many other sports when you start, so just keep in mind that you could play tennis with the most talented players from all over the world.</s>"

I also think that a lesson went well if they didn’t talk and did their work. However, when I was reading your article I felt ashamed due to the fact that when every teacher teaches the way I do it is logical that our students can’t be quiet and can’t sit without making a movement.

"Travelling by public transport is expensive and uncomfortable. The trains and buses are not big enough. There is not enough space for your legs and you often do not get a seat. This will not be a problem if you travel only short distances, but on long journeys, that will be very uncomfortable. Travelling in your own car is much more comfortable. There is the possibility to set up your seat. It is your own decision when you get up, because there are no time limitations. There are no times when you have to be at the bus stop. If you use public transport for long distances in a city, you will often change buses. There is the risk that you will not get the connecting bus and, so, you are stressed.

"The social debate between progress and traditions has been going on for centuries. Through our customs, we celebrate our past and keep our cultural heritage alive. But it is also because of these sets of beliefs, mostly of religious origins, that some societies fail to evolve and respond to the ever-changing needs of all of their people. One of the main advantages of cultural practices is that they allow societies to maintain their identities and gain economic stability. In most Latin American countries, <unk> practices such as silver<unk>ing, not only keep the region in touch with its heritage, but they have become the sole source of income for many communities. Nations like Mexico and Peru, with internationally recognized cuisines, have taken advantage of their culinary roots and boosted the production of locally grown foods, like chipotle peppers and <unk>a, to bring economic growth to their agriculture sectors. On the other hand, the greatest disadvantage of traditions, is that religious beliefs have kept these very same populations from social and human rights progress.<unk> marriage and reproductive rights are not recognized by the Costa<unk>n and most Latin governments, all because of the set of beliefs of a percentage of their community. In conclusion, traditions should be <unk> and kept alive for future generations.

"I agree with the statement, that famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. Fame is a choice of many people; it was their dream. But it doesn't mean they haven't got some rights to have private lives. Many of them have got family members who don't want to have anything in common with fame. Usually, journalists also follow them all the time. It's very important to remember if you're famous, you should protect your family. Sometimes it happens that journalists write some silly gossip about famous people which is not true. It may be a danger for the family of a celebrity, politician, famous person, and because of it some could break up. But on the other hand, being famous is a free choice for many people. They want to be rich and famous and they know that journalist will follow them. But sometimes it doesn't depend on us. If you're a queen, a member of a royal family, from your birth you'll be observed by the press and magazines. It's a price of being famous.

"No future for public transport is one of the worst things in our life. <unk>, the state makes no effort to fight it. Transportation now is very overcrowded and difficult, especially in the rush hour when people leave their jobs and go to their houses at 2 o'clock.

"An intelligent person once said: 'The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.' I totally agree with this statement and, to my mind, people should travel a lot, because our world is incredible. But there is one more question: travel by car or public transport? First of all, of course, travelling by car is much more convenient than, for example, by bus. You can drive wherever and whenever you want. Even just in cities, let alone travelling long distances. But, on the other hand, a traffic jam or bad weather can make our trip inconvenient. Moreover, there are not many parking places in big cities. Secondly, travelling by public transport is much cheaper. Not everyone can afford to travel by car every day, so they choose public transport. Thirdly, we should take care of our environment! Cars pollute our air, which leads to many diseases such as asthma, allergies and even cancer. Moreover, cars release poisonous exhaust fumes and chemicals into the air, which mix with the water in the clouds, and the polluted rain, which later falls, damages trees, lakes and buildings.

"The public transport system is overburdened today. The number of people using public transport far outstrips the number of people the transport system was designed to handle.

I would say that this is because the public transport is not so efficient as it should be. In my town, for example, I have waited for up to forty minutes before I could get a bus. I strongly believe that it is a shame because a lot of people like me would leave their vehicles at home and take a train instead. Secondly, the environment would improve.

Although a private car is more convenient for its owner than public transport, it is not in use the majority of the time and that means wasting city space on parking while it could be used as a public space. At the same time, it is not impossible to solve the task of comfort and<unk>icacy simultaneously. For instance, a network of taxi cabs with affordable prices could combine the comfort of a personal car and the work-<unk> of public transportation. Nowadays, all the car manufacturers have accepted the task of designing a robot-driven car that in future would resolve the issues of safety and availability of taxis 24 hours 7 days a week. But how is it possible to persuade citizens to make the right choice? Unfortunately, the main method is to make private cars, if not a luxury, then to make their usage economically less efficient compared to public transportation. And the underground, and light tram system are still more ecological and faster.</s>"

"Nowadays, students have a lot of different forms of education. They may not only learn in school but also through the Internet. It has both advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage of learning on the Internet is saving time. When we attend a school we often waste time on buses which we could devote to studying. In the case of Internet learning, we can set one's own hours of learning. Also, the possibility of learning at home is a big advantage, especially for people who prefer peace and silence. Then it's better to concentrate on learning and we don't feel any pressure or stress connected with questions and tests. On the other hand, learning on the internet in the long term we could feel bored or lonely. School gives opportunities for learning in groups when students can help each other and solve problems. Another disadvantage of learning on the Internet can be problems with the Internet connection. It does not always work correctly.</s>"

"Academic culture refers to the attitudes and values that are shown by the people who work or study at universities.

At first, I felt <unk>, stressed while studying in groups and used to hesitate while sharing my ideas and opinions, but now I am familiar with the academic culture. Academic culture is a challenge for many students for effective learning. Peer learning is a small group of three to five students who are kept together to discuss the content and carry out educational activities in mutual engagement. (Fisher, as cited in Strake, 2010, p.2), Peer learning is a two-way learning process in which members of a group find it easier to discuss the content. It helps to know the importance of group work by giving and receiving feedback on particular tasks. According to Hamp <unk>, the goal of an EAP (English For Academic Purpose) course is to teach students relevant study skills they need throughout their degree. It helps to share ideas and knowledge, among students and make them think critically, by using formal language while writing, and so on. In conclusion, the adoption of the Australian academic culture has developed strategies for my learning. I have become an independent learner and started to raise questions and share my opinion with the tutor. In the future, I will improve mylearning strategies by working actively in groups. </s>"

"Without a doubt, all parents want their children to be model citizens. However, raising a child into a model citizen is extremely hard work. Some people think that this job should be done by the parents and others think unfairly that this is the teacher's responsibility.

Also, parents are like models to follow for their children, and as children do what they see, they will copy their parents' actions. Indeed, school is the first place where a children interacts with society. However, they will talk or build a relationship based on what they see their parents doing with other people. Ultimately, teachers may have different values from those of the parents. On the other hand, parents may have a lack of time to spend with their children due to demanding jobs and to provide everything that their children need, for example, pay for their children's school. It can also be argued that children spend most of their time at school and not at home, making it the school's responsibility to pass on good social values. But it should not be forgotten, that parents have the most influence as they are models to follow. To sum up, parents should take full responsibility for their children's education. However, one should take into account that a school with similar values to those of the parents would be a great help in the child raising process.</s>"

Cars nowadays have technology that allows both drivers and passengers to have a better journey while listening to music or using the internet without having to spend hours standing during the journey.

"In my opinion, public transport has a future because it is cheaper than other modes of transport, also it pollutes less. The car is a more comfortable mode of transport than public transport, but it is not sustainable, its cost is higher, and if all people travel by car, the cities will be very polluted. Also, in the big cities, the public transport is more punctual than the car because public transport usually has its own lane, while if you use a car, you take more time because there is a lot of traffic in your lane. Another mode of transport that could be commonly used in the future is the bike. This mode of transport is cheap and ecological. Also, more and more the cities are building a lot of bike lanes, so it is a good alternative. For travelling to other cities or town, in my opinion, the car will remain the most used mode of transport, although new modes of transport could change this situation. Finally, I think that the most used mode of transport in the cities in the future will be the bus, metro and bike, and for travelling between cities, the car will remain the most used.</s>"

"I do agree television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed for several reasons. First, this kind of advertisement should be forbidden on account of the fact that young children are still very vulnerable. Kids around these ages (2 to 5 years old) do not have a mature critical sense and anything can easily persuade them. For instance, when I was three years old, I used to be <unk>d by all the toys which were presented in TV commercials just because of the way they were presented. One of them was ""the ultimate<unk> steel"", which was about a hundred dollars. Secondly, I am also opposed to the <unk> of this advertising because of the severe consequences it has on the parents' and child's relationships. It is common to see parents having issues with their kids because of this kind of commercial. Many parents have an unhealthy relationship, or even a wrecked relationship, with their kids.

One day, Sophia got really excited about an advertisement for a barbie doll and she could not think about anything else than having this toy. Unfortunately, my cousin did not have enough money to buy it, but her daughter - a three-year-old kid - did not understand it and got angry with Patricia, not speaking to her for three weeks! In conclusion, I am strongly in favour of this statement.<unk>ments for young kids, not only upto 5 but upto 8 years old should be forbidden because of the kid's vulnerability and the risk to their parents' relationships with them. Finally, if the advertisements are still broadcast, it is essential some educational politics comes with them, valorizing and teaching kids about understanding their parents.</s>"

"The phenomenon of homeless people has become a serious problem and many countries cannot solve this problem. The number of homeless people is increasing not just in the developing countries but all over the world. In my opinion, homeless people are victims because nobody wants to live without shelter. First of all, being without a home is a horrible problem. One of the major reasons for this problem is wars, especially in the Arab countries like Syria,<unk> and<unk>. Every day on the news we see refugees who are living in miserable conditions. They live in tents that do not protect them from cold weather or dangerous insects. They do not have enough food. In addition, financial crises. Most companies have financial problems, so the ideal solution to them is downsizing. After a while, the people who are laid off will not have enough money to live and they will become homeless people. Furthermore, street children are a result of family troubles.<unk>s of divorce are increasing and many children run away and prefer to live in the streets instead of in a home full of problems. <unk> the idea above, some people believe that homeless people are criminals and they cause danger to our society because they need money and food so they might steal or kill for this. To conclude, the world has a complicated problem, so governments and charitable organizations must take a quick decision and put in place a real solution to solve this problem. Homeless people are human beings and they must have their rights in life. </s>"
"There is an increasing trend towards private transport so that public transport will be reduced in the future. Ultimately, public transport will be negligible in the future. There are so many reasons that could affect the public transport system. The main one is that nowadays people are incredibly busy with their day to day life, so that they don't like to spend their valuable time waiting for regular transport. Also, public transport causes lots of pollution which is harmful for human beings. For example, lunchtime travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emissions of carbon monoxide, which affects red blood cells and irritates the respiratory system. As a result, they prefer private transport systems to prevent such hazards. Finally, the public transport system is not always safe. To illustrate, if teenage girls travel by public transport every day <unk> it is a big challenge for them. </s>"

"Hello Jane! Here is a picture from last summer when we were in Halland on an island called Nidingen! My name is Lorin and I am 13 years old. I live in Djursholm at Riddarv<unk>gen<unk>, close to a field. I was born on August 4 at the hospital in Danderyd. In my family there are five people; my mom Malak, my dad Claes, my little sister Novalie and my little brother Edvard. Novalie is 10 years old and Edvard is 6 years old. In my spare time I like to be with friends and I do also play soccer, dance and ski. I really like to do sports because I like to be outside. I compete in skiing and I think it's great fun. I often go skiing in <unk> re, Vemdalen and in Ramundberget. Once every year, I ski with my ski club (T<unk>by slalomklubb) in Switzerland. In Switzerland we have been to Saas fee and Zermatt. In Zermatt you can see the<unk>horn (the mountain that you see on Toblerone packaging). It is a very cool mountain. I do also ski with my family and that is the best. I like slalom because it goes fast and I like snow. In the summer holidays, my family and I just spend time on the west coast on a small island called K<unk> lhuvudet. That is one of our summerhouses. I love to be there because when we are there we swim in the ocean and we fish for crabs and just have a lot of fun. You can, of course, see the ocean and it is very beautiful. Something else I like to do is shopping. My parents call me a shopaholic and I almost agree. I like it because it is fun to look at clothes and try them on. I read quite a lot and my favourite book is Harry Potter. I like fantasy and that book is fantastic. If it was possible to go to Hogwarts I would do it. Now you know what my favourite book is, so you can almost guess what my favorite movie is... Of course, Harry Potter.

"There is no doubt that travelling by car is the most comfortable option, but claiming that public transport has no future is too much. Many people use public transport on a daily basis. There are people who wouldn't be able to travel if it wasn't for public transport. Children and elderly people can't have a driving license, so if they need to go somewhere, using public transport is their only option. Travelling by car is also very detrimental to the environment. In big cities, the air is very polluted because there are too many cars. Travelling by public transport reduces the impact on the environment, something that most people are aware of, but still they prefer to use their own vehicle. Using public transport can also save time, since you don't have to spend time looking for a place to park your car. I definitely think that public transport will continue to be very important in the future. </s>"

"Before focusing on the topic of technology itself, I would like to mention some aspects related to education. First of all, Spanish educational laws are in Europe, and probably in the world, the only ones which have changed the most in the last 30 years. This fact leads the teachers to be unsure of what they are doing. Besides, there are no results that can be analysed or checked. Secondly, there are two sorts of schools in Spain - public and private -, which leads to a big difference in the educational knowledge. While public ones must obey governmental laws strictly, private schools have some privileges. Knowing this about the Spanish education system, we can now talk about technology. I obviously agree that technology is necessary nowadays. So, schools and educational institutions in general have to update the way they teach. Technology does not imply a new instrument being taught but a new tool and source of knowledge (if used correctly). In fact, using technology without changing the content would be a total failure. Teachers must learn how to use these new technological devices in order to get their students motivated. Moreover, they should include the past information and the new information. Thus, this would help students know how the world has evolved and how it will be. In other words, technology should be used as a tool for students to be aware of the development of society and its advantages and disadvantages. These new technologies also help in the development of teaching. We can make dynamic classes by being in contact with other schools. In the case of subjects such as English and French, students would improve their skills by being in contact with students from different countries. Also, teachers could replace their<unk> following the best ones and the ones which contribute to having qualified students trained to face everyday life situations. In conclusion, as a great teacher said, we have 21st century students learning with 20th century tools 19th century knowledge.

After he understood the reason why I didn't have any desire to play, he told me to give it a try, and if I still didn't like it, he would't force me. Then, he taught me how to play. For example, when hitting, use the strength of the whole arm and don't just use your elbow, or you will feel tired quickly. While playing, I rejoiced at this exercise, because I had never sweated so much and felt refreshed before. The funniest thing to me was that I thought I was a kid who was studying in kindergarten because of the way he taught. When hitting the ball back successfully, he would say ''good, keep going"" or ""you did it''. Hitting the ball again and again, I learned I loved badminton unconsciously, because it not only includes running, but also concentrating. Badminton is an easy sport that everyone can try. Just focus on the ball and hit it back. In addition, before playing, you must warm up and relax your muscles after playing in case you suffer injuries.</s>"

I knew that I was clever enough to study all these subjects and do well in exams so I can get high marks, but they all didn't get that. They judged me for my marks, but marks don't form brains or thoughts, marks aren't the only way that makes you great now or in the future. Whatever. In high school, the senior year here in our country <unk>s your future; the college you'll spend your life studying in and working for its knowledge, so I got that I should do my best this year so my future would be better. And it happened. I showed them all that I can do whatever I want, even if <unk> like they see me, and that all my previous marks weren't my best. I got a high score and entered The faculty of Engineering, which was the top college. People's thoughts have the power to make you feel the best feeling ever and literally the opposite. Just don't think about anyone's thoughts but yours, as you have control of your life not anyone else. Your thoughts are the only ones that will make the difference, so take care only of them and believe in yourself so you can achieve the prestige you're looking for. Don't give anyone the opportunity to make you give up, and continue in a successful life. Fight. </s>"

This results in different views on whether people agree that the best things for improving people's lives have already taken place. I hold the belief that the topic is completely wrong for me, even if some improvements are easy to use and solve most problems. First, the growth of the population still continues, the space for living is still a serious problem, although the skyscraper has already solved most problems related to the population crisis. On the other hand, the skyscraper causes more problems, such as pollution. For example, I designed the high-rise architecture in a highly populated city in Taiwan. The skyscraper provides more space for excess population. However, the building will produce more pollution if the skyscrapersare constructed from modern materials, such as steel and concrete. They will destroy the environment when <unk>. The pollution will harm the local people and the environment <unk>. This is why I mentioned that the problem still exists and the problem only moves to other regions and types. Second, computer systems look like they solve most problems.

That is why our personal information always leaks to the ""hacker"".

They will use that information to steal people’s money over the phone and we will trust them because they have the correct personal information. This is a normal phenomenon in Taiwan. However, the police can’t do anything because of the hacker's anonymity.

First, it is unnecessary to spend more money on school buses, because,by<unk> 5, children are able to take care of themselves and each other.

Second, it is a good opportunity to educate them in life skills such as knowing not to sit in priority seats or leave litter on the bus.

"Compared with the past when we uses horses for transportation, did people have the same opinion that there was no future for transport, and we can only use horses?

So I think there will be a future for public transportation, and this may be because of updated technologies. </s>"

"Helping Strangers I usually help people when needed, I don't like to be a bystander. First of all, my altruistic nature is due to my biological desire to help others. For instance, one day I was walking in the park when I saw a girl falling down from a children's swing in the playing area. I helped her immediately, and after I was sure that she was fine, I called her mother and told her about this incident. She thanked me a lot. I thought she was my responsibility, but it can't be the same every time. In addition, young people display altruistic behavior from the 18th month. For example, last week I was stressed out, so I lost my phone at the university. I did not realize that until I returned home. While I was on my way to the university, my little sister <unk> for me to find my phone. So, in my opinion, children when they are witnesses always want to help strangers.

"Public transport has a big role in transportation especially in large cities like the capital city of countries. Using a car sometimes causes traffic jams if everyone uses their own car. To avoid this, a good road network is needed. Also, the cost of public transportation is lower than private transportation. On the other hand, public transportation takes more time to get to the required destination, because public transport takes a long route to get to more places and as more people take advantage of it, public transport is usually crowded and is not on time. For that reason, using your own car is more convenient than public transport. You can travel whenever you like and wherever you want. Finally, in the near future, most people will be using their own cars, because it saves a lot of time as compared with public transport and the time factor will be more important in the future.</s>"

"""Atacama 33"" ""Atacama 33"" is a recent American movie that tells the true story of a group of miners that were trapped in a mine 700 metres underground in Chile for two months. This group had a leader called Mario Casas, played by Antonio Banderas. The film is well-developed and shows the audience every little issue and difficulty that the miners had to go through. However, the first 17 days in the movie could become a bit tedious because the director focused on every single feeling of the trapped men and their families. After that lapse, the rescuers found the place where the miners were hiding and the moment to rescue them started. The characters were perfect because they were people from Chile and Bolivia that were involved in the real accident. Antonio Banderas did an excellent job acting as a desperate leader committed to the local people. Despite some details, I think you mustn't miss this film if you want to know the truth about the recent miracle called ""the Chilean miners"". </s>"

Then you realise that running is a way of life, a healthy way of life.

At the beginning, I had a flatmate who loved cycling and running, even in a city like Madrid. Therefore, we went out at night after university classes and we preferred soft soil paths to pavement.

"There are many different types of music in the world today. Why do we need music? Is the traditional music of a country more important than the International music that is heard everywhere nowadays? Music is a special world. It has its own rules, tools and people who are specialized in it. Over decades, music is an eternal art which develops day by day. We need music most of the time or even every single day, to enrich our days with happiness and joy, and also to melt away sorrows or depression that can affect us and prevent us from doing our best. Music is a science! Yes it is. It has many branches and types. Some are traditional: owned by any part of the world, and the other international types that all people throughout the world share. The traditional or local music of a certain area has its thumb print on the people in that part of the world.

For example, In Northern Sudan, people have been using the "" Tam<unk>"" as a traditional <unk> for their songs. Internationally, the kinds of music are many.

"Nowadays, the healthy habits of young people are very different than in the nineties. And we need to know the reason for these changes and what we can do to improve them. Firstly, it is true that young people used to do sports daily anywhere, at school or in the street, and also they didn't use to eat fast food. Secondly, many people argue that society has experienced great changes in family life. Parents work outside the home all day. Although they want the best for their children, sometimes it is difficult because they are tired and they tend to prepare junk food and allow them to spend their time on the internet or playing with video games. In my opinion, parents should be concerned about their family's comfort and should motivate their children to do sport, be in contact with a lot of people and avoid eating fast food.</s>"
"In terms of holidays, some people like to visit their own countries, while others prefer going abroad. I think going abroad is much more exciting. Visiting your own country certainly has its advantages. First of all, you don't have to take very long trips. Also, you can have the opportunity to discover new places just next to your home. Besides, this type of vacation is usually less expensive than going abroad. On the other hand, many people prefer visiting other countries. Actually, they like the idea of visiting an unknown land, where everything is different, from the weather to the habits. Furthermore, they also like going abroad to visit important and famous cities around the world, like Paris, Madrid, New York. In my opinion, traveling to a foreign country makes people open their minds to other cultures. In fact, going abroad is a nice way to make new friends, try new things and improve a foreign language. In addition, if you plan your vacation at the last minute, you can also save money on planes or hotels. In conclusion, I think it's important to know both our own countries and foreign lands. </s>"

"There are many fields of study that have not been discovered or researched by humans. There are many reasons why research is hardly conducted. As a result, there is a debate about whether educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing a field of study in which they are unlikely to succeed. <unk> I agree with the statement, with qualifications, for the following reasons. Admittedly, some of the research needs investment in many resources that educational institutions cannot afford. Such research will indeed fail. Educational institutions should dissuade students. However, if there is not a lack of resources for the field of study, educational institutions should support students in their field of study. Education’s greatest purpose is to encourage students to try and to learn from failure. Take Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, for example.
