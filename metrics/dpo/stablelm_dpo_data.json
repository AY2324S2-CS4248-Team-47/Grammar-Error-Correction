My ex-husband taught me not to be involved with some kind of people by analyzing his behavior before commitment. During our dating he was very charming and attentive. We discussed about some sexist ideas that I don't agree with what the society demands on people and I noticed a little sexism of him, but I was fine with that because That can happen, but due to my profession he couldn't be like that for so long because I was in a man's shoes. He was very jealous but I thought it would fade away with time and with the gaining of the trust but it did not and ended up making me sick by the time passed. I learned that a man does anything to conquer a woman, he even does a lot of hateful things for him such as going to her home every night to stay together or to hang out, while later you find out that he hates going to places except his house. I learned a man says anything just to shut you up and not discuss just to have some love moments. He does not end an argument and give a position to understand your point, he thinks he is right and does not want to think about it. I also learned that men think in a different way from the women during the day. For example, while women think about millions things like what they want to do or have to do during the day, while men just do nto think about anything and can be like that for hours, just whith a blank mind. But in my opinion this should be an excuse to think something that women shouldn't know anything about. I also learned that is the mother that gives the principles and the direction of a man's mind, and depending on her he is going to be a sexist or not, he is going to help and be an honor man or not, he is going to be a good and caring father or not, he is going to be a responsible human being or not. A mother is very fundamental and the basis for the men principles and beliefs. Women do not knoe their importance for the future on their own homes.

It is certain that each of us loves to travel, but everyone likes the most comfortable means of transport. For me, the best way to travel is train, because I think this mode of transportation has the most pros. One of the things that is very important to me is the price. I'm not going to spend a lot of money for a ticket, because I'm studying so I just have a part-time job. If we check the prices of air travel, we can be disappointed as well as of travel by boat. Fortunately the train tickets are cheaper. Another very important thing is the travel time. Plane flies very quickly, but you have to be at the airport at least an hour earlier. In the case of a ship, travel time is immense. Travelling by train is quite fast, and pleasant, I can safely travel to more places worldwide than people taking a boat or plane transport.

In Korean, people should completed military service at least 2 years. Similarly, people have to join it 1 year in Taiwan. It is a debate that should everyone have to complete military service when they reach 18 years old. With supporters maintaining that it is important for national security and make people maturity,whilst opponents claim that the military service have effects on study and should have freedom of choice. Firstly,every countries acquire stabilization must be protected by a stronger armed forces for national security. If the war or other dangerous threat the safety of country,they can not get help from other countries immediately. Therefore,people accept military service could be easier to protect their country. Especially some small population of country have policy that is people need join military service due to develop into a powerful country. Secondly, the important for people become maturity when they completed military service, which probably is a particular experience for 18 years old. In addition to have hard physical training and get different special skills,people also can improve personal quality in military service. Consequently,people could be more independent and strong,they seems to earlier become mature than other people who do not completed military service. In contrast, opponents of military service point out that study is the first vital thing for people who reach 18 years old. Military service mainly to improve physical,however study might be completed better in school at the age because it has professional teacher team and a good study atmosphere,people usually easier to concentrate on learning knowledge. For instance, some countries allowed people join military service after their all courses was finished. Additionally, critics argue that countries are able to allow people have freedom of choice for military service. Relatively some people unwilling join military service,people volunteered in a military service possibly enjoy it. Furthermore,it also can respect for right s of people,especially for women who do not can adapt the hard training. In conclusion, it can be concluded that military service is necessary for national security and good for people improve themselves. The best course of action would be government attempt to allow people volunteered in conscription when they completed their studies. </s>", "Hi Paty. I<unk>m going to tell you about me.

The plot revolves around Vianne Rocher, a single mother and chocolate expert, opening a \u2018chocolaterie\u2019 right before Lent in a small, close-minded French village, the mayor of which decides to boycott her. During Lent, the protagonist gets to know other outcasts (mainly women) and help them. However, Vianne must learn to solve her own problems and change the course of her own life. One of the strengths of the film is its star-studded cast: Juliette Binoche as Vianne, Alfred Molina as the mayor, Judi Dench as a grumpy, elder woman resented with the oppressing society of the village, and a young Johnny Depp as a handsome gypsy arriving in town with his caravan. Each and every one of the roles is beautifully written and the actors don\u2019t fail in bringing them to life. Besides the cast, I would like to highlight the original soundtrack. It adapts perfectly to the theme of the movie, with a little bit of jazz manouche, a popular genre amongst European gypsy communities, and reminiscences of Mexican folklore, as the recipes Vianne Rocher prepares in the \u2018chocolaterie\u2019 are a heritage from her Maya ancestors. If I had to find a down side to Chocolat, it would be that the film format does not allow us to have a deeper look into some of the characters and their storylines. Had it not been written in the year 2000, but today, I am sure that this story would have been turned into a successful TV series in which we could have learnt more about the past and the future of those fantastic characters. All in all, this is a gripping, moving, and entertaining film that will make you reflect on some social issues. A must-see if, like me, you enjoy cinema with strong female characters on the lead roles, but you do not necessarily want to watch another dramatic story. </s>", "Nowadays, students have a lot of various form of education.

Through our customs, we celebrate our past and keep our cultural heritage alive. But it is also because of these set of beliefs, mostly of religious origins, that some societies fail to evolve and respond to the ever-changing needs of all of their people. One of the main advantages of cutural practices is that they allow societies to maintain their identities and gain economic stability. In most Latin American countries, millenary practices such as silversmithing, not only keep the region in touch with its heritage, but they have become the sole source of income for many communities. Nations like Mexico and Peru, with internationally recognized cuisines, have taken advantage of their culinary roots and boosted the production of locally grown foods, like chipotle peppers and quinoa, to bring economic growth to their agriculture sectors. On the other hand, the greatest disadvantage of traditions, is that religious beliefs have kept these very same populations from social and human rights progress. Gay marriage and reproductive rights are not recognized by the Costa Rican and most Latin governments, all because of the set of beliefs of a percentage of their community. In conclusion, traditions should be cherished and kept alive for future generations. However, the safekeeping of these practices should never become a priority over the wellbeing of the collective. Progress and traditions are not opposites in a socie ty were respect and tolerance for others is the priority. </s>", "My favourite sport is badminton and I always get up early to play it every day.

A large list of characters appears through the episodes, being the common thread that connects the two seasons the regular ones: Martin Compston (as DS Steve Arnott), Vicky McClure (as DC Kate Fleming) and Adrian Dunbar (as PSupt Ted Hastings). Therefore, the first chapter features Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott, a high-flying counter-terrorism officer, who is recruited to AC-12 after refusing to collude with his colleagues in the cover-up of a failed operation in which a man was mistaken shot by another cop. He\u2019s one of AC-12\u2019s leading investigators although he sometimes has the tendency to let his personal feelings sways his professional judgement. Fleming plays his partner\u2019s part, an AC-12\u2019s undercover specialist, who prides herself on being the consummate professional, unmoved by emotional considerations. Both of them share superior, Hastings, who remains the ethically upstanding senior investigating officer; zealous and suspicious, not being everyone's cup of tea. Even though being widely recognised for his impeccable ethical standards, he hides a drastic change in his personal circumstances. Their scenes are repeatedly stolen, though, by the real stars of the show, the officers who are under suspicion of corruption: Lennie James (DCI Tony Gates) in the first season, and Keeley Hawes (DI Lindsay Denton) in the second one.

Therefore, good leaders should know how to motivate their staff. It is clear that staff would spend more time on their tasks if they were motivated by their boss, while unmotivated employees are more likely to spend less effort in their jobs. Generally speaking, there are two basic methods of employee motivation: rewards involving money and non-financial rewards. Many leaders believe that money is the best, however, from my own perspective, the non-financial rewards are the best approach to motivate employees and I will prove my opinion in this essay. </s>", "I think that 50 years ago people couldn't even imagine what the life would be like in our time.

I am sure only about one thing: technologies will have a more important place in our lives. Maybe in 50 years people won't work as we do now, instead will build only robots. Maybe in 50 years we will find out how our brain works and we will be able to create an artificial intelligence system that would solve all our problems.

Maybe by doing this we would be able to find other civilisations and exchange technologies with them.

One child whose parents come from different countries is able to learn two languages at the same time, this child doesn't need to go abroad to learn a foreign language, but they are listening to their parents speaking English their native language all the time and this let them learn without any difficulty. On the other hand, if you go abroad you will be able to improve your English in anglophone country, in this case, your knowledge will be reinforced with your stay there. To sum up, if you want to learn English you don't need to go abroad, you can improve your English working hard inside your own country, for example, doing exercises like listening and writing or you can meet with native people who speak English to practise with them.

Other transport that can be very used in the future is the bike, this transport is cheap and ecological, also, more and more the cities are building a lot bike lane so is a good alternative. For travelling other cities or town, in my opinion, the car will remain the transport most used, although the new transports could change this situation.

Once a curious novelty that was largely considered a harmless addition to our sometimes dull and overly familiar environment, it was welcomed as fun and informative. It was also - if one wished to do so - relatively easy to ignore. But we have now entered a new era of the attention-grabbing business: its digitalisation. Their transformation from innocent posters to digital screens ranging in size from miniscule to vast has made adverts all-pervasive. Researchers say that an average adult in the developed world is now exposed to hundreds of commercial messages every day. Those involved in this lucrative business are in awe of the almost endless possibilities that recent technological advances offer them. Multimedia, advertising and entertainment companies now work in synergy to target everyone from toddlers who can barely speak to pensioners confused with the speed of life in the new age, unsubtly playing on their needs and desires in order to turn them all into faithful consumers. They have so successfully infiltrated their own product into our everyday existence that we no longer see it anymore as what it really is: a nuisance. Creators of adverts have long given up on informing the consumers and instead opted for seducing them. The result are insincere, misleading and often deceitful messages that our minds are saturated with. Perhaps it is time to do an experiment and hit a pause button and reflect upon this subject matter. Imagine a world without adverts, for a week at least. Would it be bleak and boring and leave us at a loss as what to buy, or might it just turn out to be a long yearned for respite? </s>", "Dear Paul, we didn't seen for a while so you don't know much about me lately.

But I hope one day go to a tournament, travel to Spain and watch my favourite player who is Rafael Nadal from Spain. Since the first time I watched him play, eight years ago was the same year that I started watch Tennis. I like how the players moved through the court and how the audience applaused them every time they won a point, although I'm not in the court I could feel the feeling of the game, it's really awesome. Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real. My advice would be that I you want to play Tennis just go ahead play it, not expect till others do it, because you can do that too. At the beginning it could be a little harsh, but is the same with many others sports when they start, so just keep in mind that you can play Tennis with the most talented players from the world overall.</s>", "The members of my Family are certain my real best friends, whose i can trust and ask everything without shameless or regrets.

Needless to say, in order to combat the rising tide of the social problems in Hampshire, the Education Authority decided to increased funds for the educational sector. Sports Club Sportive activities might boots the student's overall condition and this is the reason why they are necessary. It is well known that physical activity contributes to improving physical and mental health. Drama Club This kind of club will allow students to express their feelings in a non-violent manner, learn how to manage their reactions and develop creative talent. A drama club will make examining plays such as Shakespeares' more enjoyable than solely studying them will. Cookery classes Cookery classes are very important because students here are young adults that need to have basic skills such as cooking or order to manage themselves and live an independent life. Cooking classes will helps students spend less money on eating out and they will start eating healthier because by making their own food they will be more aware of what they are eating. DYI Classes \"Do it yourself\" classes improve practical skills. As most college students will soon leave for university and will live in dorms, without their parents, they are oblidged to solve malfunctions by themselves. The information they acquired during these courses will help them for the rest of their lives. Citizenship classes Another kind of classes that are necessary are citizenship classes as teenagers nowadays are deficient in this field. These courses will develop the civic sense of students and they will start involving actively in society. Conclusion The overall purpose of these actions is to keep young adults in school and to educate them.

Some people think that knowing fact is more easily and practicable. Nevertheless, others consider learning ideas and concept is the best way to confront many academic and real-life problems. In my view, l completely agree with the idea that it is important to students to learn idea and concept than learn facts. I would like to explain my reasons. First, learning facts can help students to solve one kind of problems that they may face. However, ideas and concepts give people competitive edge in dealing with other similar issues. For example, once I do n\u2019t grasp an idea that my teacher have explained in class, but just remember facts. When I do my homework, I find the problem is different than the case discussed in the class. While, I go back to my textbook and try to realize ideas and concepts. I work out the problem easily. From this experience, I learn that I do not just remember facts, but try my best to understand ideas and concept. thus, I can solve many kinds of problem simply. Second, learning ideas and concepts support self-education greatly. Consequently, you can reach high academic levels. It is easy to know facts from people around you. However, learning ideas and concepts need more investigation and understanding many of the academic textbooks.. Nowadays, there are limited time for any teacher to cover all point in a certain subject. When, students catch the idea of any topic it will be easy to understand all issue related to it deeply. For instance, when I was in senior year in high school. I took physics class. It was massive materials on a specific issue, but I attempted my best to catch its notion that made me recognize any unmentioned points. In sum, absorbing ideas and facts is the most effective strategy. Not only do student learn more in their studying, but also they help students understanding many facts in our life better than any other ways. </s>", "This review is to tell you about the Astoux restaurant, which is situated in the heart of Cannes on the seashore.

Taking acceptance the strength of music, it is hard to imagine human life without it. \"Music is the nutrition for our souls\" said in the popular proverb. Therefore, we can feel the enormous role of music in our lives. To my mind, beautifulness of music does not depend on its sorts. People enjoy it and do not think about its genre. For example, there are various music competitions Eurovision Song Contest which organized in many countries. People almost from all over the world attends to participate in it. Being the core of culture of a country, it influences on national fame. For instance, in our country music consists of two main parts: Mougam and Folk music, which have been getting popularity from all regions in the world since it was sprung. However, modern music is not always acceptable for different people. Despite that it is held by the majority of countries.

Most of the countries enjoy such intertwining that could be considered as a new type of music. Inasmuch as this process makes peoples close to each other encouraging them to corporate and befriend.

After I joined ACU (Australian Catholic University) I have found vast differences in teaching method between Nepal and Australia. In Nepal students study individually, do not ask questions with the tutor even if they are confused. Meanwhile, Australian education is based on making students learn new skills. Students need to have an active participation in discussion with their peers. Besides, students are able to raise questions with the lecturer because they can express their opinion. At first I felt difficult, stressed while studying in groups used to hesitate while sharing my ideas, opinion but now I am familiar with the academic culture. Academic culture is challenge for many students for effective learning. Peer learning is a small group of three to five students who are kept together to discuss the content and carry out educational activities in mutual engagement. (Fisher, as cited in Strake, 2010, p.2), Peer learning is a two way learning process in which members of group feel easier to discuss the content. It helps to know the importance of group work by giving and receiving feedback on particular tasks. According to Hamp (2002), the goal of EAP (English For Academic Purpose) course is to teach students relevant study skills they need throughout their degree. It helps to share the ideas, knowledge, among the students and make them think critically, by using formal language while writing and so on. In conclusion, the adoption of Australian academic culture has developed strategies for my learning. I have become an independent learner and started to raise a question, share my opinion to the tutor. In the future I will enhance learning strategies by working actively in group. </s>", "sports is very much beneficial for our health. i would like to play football because it's too much exciting game. in proportion to length it takes only 90 minutes. whenever i got the opportunity i played football.</s>", "Sport is important part of my life.

I totally agree with this statement and, to my mind, people should travel a lot because our world is incredible. But there is one more question: travel by car or public transport? First of all, of course, travelling by car is much more convenient than, for example, by bus. You can drive wherever and whenever you want. Even just in cities, let it alone travelling at long distances. But, on the other hand, traffic jam or bad weather can make our trip inconvenient. Moreover, there are not many parking places in big cities. Secondly, travelling by public transport is much cheaper. Not all people can afford travelling by car every day so they choose public transport. Thirdly, we should take care of our environment! Cars pollute our air what leads to many diseases such as asthma, allergy and even cancer. Moreover, cars release poisonous exhaust fumes and chemicals into the air, which mix with the water in the clouds, and the polluted rain, which later falls, damages trees, lakes and buildings. So, my advice is to travel by bicycle (at least, use public transport) because it is environmentally friendly!</s>", "Next Monday, I am going to India. I love India so much.

I'm of the opinion that people's lives won't change extremely in the next 50 years. Of course there will exist some more electronical things like some new handys, with functions we could expect right now, and there will be some other gadgets. But if we speak of the change of people's lives there have to be some more dramatically things. A point would be, that normal people are able to fly to the moon or something, or if there would be people living on the mars. But I think that this won't be able to do. Even not in 50 years.

I personally think so, the reasons are as below: First, As we all know, Cars play a very important role in our life, the more and more cars come into our family. Also travelling, of course, that's a big part of the function of the car! The very well developed highways, roads, city streets provide a good foundation for the cars, look at the North America, the highways were developed anywhere, it's really your own lose if you don't drive a car, drive on them(highways) Second, Human start to learn driving at the age of 16, and they can master the driving skills very quickly( within a month or two), soon they can drive to wherever they want to go, and we also see people at the age of 80 still drive to their destinations as they got used to it. so who care to bother taking the public transportation anymore? Third, The public transportation sucks, when you think about it, you can picture the crowded subways, dirty buses, and the difficulty/hussults between the public transportation transfer in your mind. The wasted time also should weight in, whether it is waiting for the trains, or waiting for the delayed buses, not to mention the longer time it takes compared to travelling in a car. And driving your own car can be very convenient too, it can right come to your own garage. All in all, Public transport is not as fast as a car can be; it's not as convenient as a car can provide, so it's future is in doubt. </s>", "In my life,many dreams have existed in my mind,which is sweet,incredible,magical or horrible.However,one of dreams is keeping in my heart that I can't forget it forever.

The benefits of swimming are that your body is healthy and your brain is alert. To practise this sport first you have to meet someone who teaches you how to swim because it is a beautiful sport but it is also dangerous.You have to have a good coach and a good swimsuit.If you try it you can do it.

I should present a little bit of history of it. After more than seven hundred years, in 1733, the latin-catholic bishops residence was moved from Cenad to Timisoara, where the first cathedral became the church of jesuists monks.The design of the actual Dom was realized in baroque style of Vienna. The cathedral hasa height of 55 m. The Dom was rise at rank of first church of Timisoara by the empress Maria Tereza in 1756.What is very interesting to see is a painting made by Michelangelo Uterberger showing Saint Gheorghe riding and fighting with the basilisk.The visitors programme is from Monday to Sunday, from ten o\u2019clock a.m to six p.m. And a phone number where you can call for more information is 0040212345678.</s>", "Day by day, the power of consumption increases more and more and one of the areas you can realize this is in the traffic. People who have facilities to buy or finance something and looking for convenience, have a great desire to buy a car. The bad quality of public transportation and the lack of options like underground and train, helps people choose to use a car. These things makes we think if the public transport has a future, after all to do all the things you need in your routine like to go to work, to go shopping or just to go out with the family, is more comfortable by car than by bus. Cars nowadays have technology that allow both drivers and passengers to have a better travel while listening to a music or use the internet without having to spend hours standing during the journey. The government needs to invest in better conditions of the public transport, with more options to the transportation of citizens, in order to make it easier to go from a place to another, and hardest the decision to choose between car or bus.</s>", "It is undoubtedly true that in today's modern world people commute to work mostly by their private vehicles.It seems more convenient to them to move on their own rather than tied to a public transport. It can be argued that public transport system has been loosing its popularity in many ways. People feel that they can get to their destinations on time if they drive their own car.It is true in many cases as public transport like buses,trains and trams have their own specific routes and stops.This may cause people in getting late to their particular destination. Secondly, public transport seems to be going expensive day by day which has reduced its popularity. People therefore find cars more affordable for them. In modern society cars have become more cheaper to buy,which in turn has helped people to have them. Moreover,many car finance companies have made it easy for every individual to purchase the car. In conclusion,i would say that due to recent advancements in society,there has been a considerable increase in the car ownership.It can therefore be predicted easily that there will be no role of public transport in the future.</s>", "My idol was, is and will always be Justin Bieber. I remember the first time that I saw his videos, I didn't write his last name correctly and I couldn't find him on YouTube. It started when I was 12 or 13 years old, his music meant everything to me. He was always talking about follow your dreams and never give up. In 2014 I met a couple from One Direction called Larry Stylinson but they can't \"come out\" because of his managers. I admire them because no matter what their managers make them go through, they always find the way to show us how much they love each other and how much they want to be free. I really hope this \"hiatus\", this is how they called their break, they can be happy and spend time together without fake girlfriends, managers or the media around them. I want them to be happy.

I'm a freak when it comes to football. I think I had watched almost all the football matches in history especially when it was the FIFA World Cup season. I would not sleep until the game was over. Although, I don't play really well, but I would choose it over any other sports any day. I enjoy playing football because the feeling you get when you are on the field is priceless. I would feel free when I'm in the field. I was told that I was a natural player when I was young. I didn't need any coaching since my football skills came naturally.

I do believe that with time people become more conscious of the idea of cities convenient to everyone. Despite private car is more convenient to its owner then public transport, it is not in use the majority of time and that means wasting city space for parking while it could be used as a public space. At the same time it is not impossible to solve the task of comfort and efficacy simultaneously. For instance network of taxi cabs with affordable prices could combine comfort of personal car and work-load of public transportation. Nowadays all the car manufacturers accepted the task of design robot-driven car that in future would resolve the issue of safety and availability of taxi 24 hours 7 days a week. But how is it possible to persuade citizens to make a right choice? Unfortunately the main method is to make private cars if not a luxury then to make their usage economically less efficient in favour to public transportation. And underground, light tram system are still more ecological and fast.</s>", "Some people like shopping. Some people love shopping and some people can not live without shopping.

Nevertheless, being famous has both its benefits and drawbacks. First of all, celebrities are usually wealthy, so they have an easier life than other people. Luxurious homes, cars, expensive clothes and other pleasures of life are then available when people become famous. Moreover, they travel all around the world and spend their holidays in expensive resorts, get the best hotel rooms and the most efficient service. On the other hand, lack of privacy is a major disadvantage in a famous person's life as their personal life's boundaries are constantly trespassed by paparazzi and journalists. Besides, the more they succeed, the more their fans expect of them to achieve. Owing to this state of constant stress, many of them are bound to have alcoholism problems, drug-addiction and depression. In conclusion, fame may be nice but it <unk>s not an easy path to walk on.

If you are going to start practise it, I would recommend you to start taking lessons with an expert instructor. It is very important to check the equipment first.

Public transport include buses, trains, and subway, however cars, bicycles, taxis are not forgotten. In the moment of choosing, very different aspects like ecological effects, the economic viability and even time uses, take part on the decision. Firstly, the car option is the best one in comfort, because you do not depend on a specific time to travel and modern cars have the best technology in equipment and facilities. Then public transport is not as comfortable as the previous one, because luckily you can find a place to sit and forget it if it is in the rush hour. By the other hand, traffic is the biggest trouble talking about transport, cars facilities are replaced by the need of punctuality and, depending on the city, the delays are a concerning point when we talk about travelling by bus or trains. However, the economic aspect is very important to consider when we talk about convenience, cars are the most expensive ones. Not only because of the oil'prices, but also the costs of enssurance, the car, the parking taxes, etc. In comparisson with a bus ticket that costs four pesos and you are sure that sooner or later it will come. To sum-up, neither cars nor public transport is considered the perfect option, but considering long term consequences as is nowadays common in some European countries, bicycles are the best way. Riding a bicycle reduces traffic, costs, ecological impact, and even car crushes.

After studying our advertising options, it was found that two of them can be suitable for our purpose. One way is to put advertising on the internet and use social networks. On the other hand, we can set up stands in shopping malls. In order to obtain maximum benefit from this it will be helpful if we give away product samples. As I mentioned above, advertising campaign must be appropriate to the target market. I therefore feel justified in recommending that the campaign in shopping malls will be more effective for us.

As a result, there is the debate whether educational institutes have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing field of study in which they are unlikely to succeed. In my opinion, I agree with the statement with qualifications by following reasons. Admittedly, some of the research need to invest many resources that educational institutes cannot afford. Such research indeed will fail. Educational institutes should dissuade students. However, if there is not lack of the resource for the field of study, Educational institutes should support students for their study area. Education\u2019s greatest purpose is to encourage student to attempt and learn from the fail. Take Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, for example. He tried a lot of different materials to make filament of the light bulb. Once, people think he would succeed. Even though the research really cannot succeed. Students can learn some things from the course of the research. In the course of the research, students will think how to develop process of the research and know which segment will cause the problem making the research fail. In addition, students in the course of research maybe create serendipity. Like Alexander Flrming Alexander, the inventor of the antibiotic, discovered the Penicillin accidentally from the research of the germ. \u201cYou must do the thing you think you cannot do.\u201d said by Eleanor Roosevelt. The invaluable thing is to turn the impossibility to possibility.

Therefore, it is inevitable that we have to learn to be part of the society. Parents, in some cases, are mentors to children. However, considering the complexity of the society, I believe it better to learn in schools rather than from parents. First of all, there is no denying that parents may teach their children enormous fundamental living skills, on which their progeny count. Nevertheless, the skills are not diverse enough for children to deal with specific problems when living in a complex society. For example, one of my senior high school's classmate had encountered communication problem involved in the other's family. As a consequence, they never talk to each other since then. Following the previous paragraph, there will always be people of different living styles, attitudes, and beliefs in every aspect of one's life. Have we not lived and learned the skills in a group, especially in school, we will not be skilled before entering the society. The society as a whole is a place where both competition and cooperation take turn continuously influence every member. If we only live in our original family, parents will probably forgive us when we make mistakes. In contrast, living in a society is another story: people might blame, compete, or even hurt others no matter who you are. Learning in schools, however, provides valuable opportunity for children to learn not only from teachers, but also from relationships between peers, and as a result, proves the way for being independent in the future. In a nutshell, there is a great deal of knowledge needs to be gained for children in order to live in a society. School, a place with diverse students along with their attitudes towards lives, might be better than learning merely with the parents.</s>", "It is well known that an image is better than a thousand words and that may be the reason for the success of television in a recent survey as the most important invention of the last 100 years. However, this election could not be the wisest as there are other inventions more useful than television and with better future applications. I am referring to the Internet. Born in the 1970's as a military project to interconnect the missile facilities and the central headquarters, it soon spread to universities and educational centers. This fact, along with the spreading of personal computers, quickly became in a generalization of its use in the first decade of the XXI century. Nobody wants to dismiss the importance of television and its achievements. For more than 50 years it has been the main entertainment channel displacing others as radio, theater, cinema and, sadly, also books. In its first years television was also an important channel to culture (theater plays, classic films, etc.). Unfortunately, in the last years television has lost this educational focus. The Internet, on the other side, has became more and more popular not only for entertainment but also for business and today is almost impossible to find an activity in which the Internet doesn't play a major role. The Internet has also replaced television to watch films and TV shows, especially among young people who prefer to download and watch the videos instead of watching on the fixed schedule of TV.</s>", "Nowadays it's believed that it's better to work on your own than to work as a group.

In the listening passage, the professor discusses the advantages of alcohol and how it helps to reduce heart attacks and strokes by 40 percent, due to the fact that it reduce blood clot, and slowing the deterioration of brain function. In addition, moderate drinking helps to keep healthy movement, because some researches has shown that people who drink moderately have less proportion of body fat, because alcohol speed up metabolism which makes calories burn quickly.

This point of view is based on, for example, that you shares an important bond with your family or that you know everything about some members, like your cousins and they know everything about you. Maybe, most of us have spent our childhood with our cousins and they were our best friends for ages. Siblings are another strong point to support this statement. It's usual to hear that this kind of bond is the strongest inside a family, because everybody thinks that siblings are the only ones whom you could rely on, despite not always it's true. I should talk in the third person because I don't have any brothers or sisters, but a close cousins. In my case, this role is played by them.

The traditional or local music of a certain area has it's thumb print on the person of that part. And the instruments used in that local music may vary from sort to another.

Some people believe, however, that community service orders are more appropriate in some cases. When do you think that it is right to order people to work in the community to pay for their crimes?\u201d In recent years, the most common punishment for criminals has been prison. There are certain people who believe community service orders are more adequate in some cases. People who break the law, should be ordered to work in community in order to pay for their misdeeds, when they have done a minor offence or if they have acted unintentionally. Community service orders are more appropriate than prison punishments when people have acted unintentionally. Sending criminals to prison is a serious verdict for people that have made a mistake. Nobody is sinless and people should not be treated as serious as being sent to jail. For example, graffiti makers in Bulgaria are sent to prison for 4 years. This is unfair, because they do not do any harm to the environment nor to the society. It is better that they do a certain amount of community work, for example clean their graffiti, which will teach them how hard it is to clean graffiti, and thus, prevent them from making new ones. Working in the community is more adequate compared to sending people to prison when criminals have done a minor offence. Limiting people\u2019s freedom because of minor, non-harmful to the society crimes is inhumane. Everybody deserves freedom, despite its crimes. Although their misdeeds should not be tolerated, I believe that had better do some community work. This will help them understand their mistakes and prevent them in future. For example, in Bulgaria, people who lay down and relax on the grass in the park are sent to jail for 6 years, because they are considered \u201cdoing serious damage to the environment and preventing the park from further development\u201d. Community service orders should be used when people have acted unintentionally and when they have conceded a minor offence, as this will help them realize their mistakes, without them being limited in freedom by being sent to prison. This will help them realize their mistakes and thus, quit doing them. </s>", "Michael was alittle boy he was 10 years old he went with his parents to his grandfather's home.

I live in the Netherlands and at our school it\u2019s the same. Our pupils have to sit for many hours a day, and they find it hard to sit still and to be silent. I also think that a lesson went well if they didn\u2019t talk and did their work. However, when I was reading your article I felt ashamed due to the fact that when every teacher teaches the way I do it is logical that our students can\u2019t be quiet and can\u2019t sit without making a move. Moreover, when we as teachers have a study day, I get tired myself by sitting all day. Your key takeaway #3 was shocking for me, the feeling of being a nuisance is dreadful. In my opinion I am very patient and willing to explain difficult topics over and over again. I really hope my students feel the same, otherwise I have to change my attitude! I get paid for being a teacher and, as I see it, it is my job to clarify and help my pupils to understand. Your experience gave me food for thought especially when you wrote that our pupils are sitting passively and listening during approximately 90 per cent of their classes. I am going to look at my lessons again to see if I can change those lessons and try to make my pupils active. I teach at Basisberoeps level and I have already started to use some activities were they must use an Ipad and make pictures or short films.

First, this kind of advertisement should be forbiden reasoning the fact young children are still strongly vulnerable. Kids around these age (2 to 5 years old) do not have a maturated critical sense and anything can easyly persuade them. For instance, when I was three years old I used to be captivated for all the toys which were presented on tv commercials just because the way they were exposed. One of them was \"the ultimate max steel\" which was about a hundred dollars. Secondly, I am also opposed the allowance of this advertisement because the severely consequence it causes into the parents and child's relationships. It is common we see parents having issues with their kids in reason to this kind of commercial. Many parents have an unhealthy relationship, or even a wrecked relationship, with their kids. One example is what happened with/to my cousin Patricia when she had her first child called Sophia. One day sophia got really excited with an advertisement about barbie doll and she could not think about anything else than having this toy. Unfortunately, my cousin did not have enough money to buy it, but her daughter - a three years old kid- did not understand it and got angry with Patricia, do not speaking well with her for three weeks! In conclusion, I am strongly favourable to this statement. Advertisement for young kids, not only until 5 but until 8 years old should be forbiden reasoning the kid's vulnerability and the risk to their parents' relationships with them.

First of all, Spanish educational laws are in Europe, and probably in the world, the only ones which have changed the most in the last 30 years. This fact leads the teachers to be unsure of what they are doing. Besides, there are no results that can be analysed or checked. Secondly, there are two sorts of schools in Spain-public and private-, which produces a big difference in the educational knowledge. While public ones must obey governmental laws strictly, private schools have some privileges. Knowing this about the Spanish education system, we can now talk about technology. I obviously agree that nowadays technology is necessary. So, the schools and the educational institutions in general have to update the way they teach. Technology does not imply a new instrument to be taught but a new tool and source of knowledge (if used correctly). In fact, using technology without changing the contents would be a total failure. Teachers must learn how to use these new technological devices in order to get their students motivated. Moreover, they should comprise the past information and the new one. Thus, this would help students know how the world has evolved and how it will be. In other words, technology should be used as a tool for the students be aware of the development of society and its advantages and disadvantages. This new technologies also help in the teaching development. We can make dynamic classes by being in contact with other schools, in the case of subjects such as English and French, students would improve their skills by being in contact with students from different countries. Also, teachers could replace their methodologies following the best ones and the ones which contribute to have qualified students trained to face everyday life situations.

Many people use public transport on a daily basis. There are people who wouldn't be able to travel if it wasn't for public transport. Children and elders can't have a driving license, so if they need to go somewhere, using public transport is their only option. Travelling by car is also very detrimental for the environment. In big cities, the air is very polluted because there are too many cars. Travelling by public transport lowers the impact on the environment, something that most people are aware of, but still they prefer to use their own vehicle. Using public transport can also save time, since you don't have to spend time looking for a place to park your car. I definitely think that public transport will continue to be very important in the future. </s>", "Personally I prefer different movies. The choice always depends on my mood.

First, it is unnecessary to spend more money on school buses because by Grade 5 children are able to take care of themselves and each other. They can communicate well and are aware of dangerous situations. For example, if they see drunk or dirty people on public buses, they could avoid sitting near them or report them to the bus driver. Second, it is a good opportunity to educate them in life skills such as knowing not to sit in priority seats or leave litter on the bus. In contrast, I think that the parents who insist their children should only travel on school buses protect them too much. In daily life, many youngsters need to go to school and back by public transportation. In other words, if parents spoil their offspring then they may become too dependent and incapable of functioning well in society later on. In conclusion, it is not only a good chance to take the children on an adventure, but also help them become independent young adults. I think this way can assist them in adapting to society early.</s>", "My favourite sport is swimming. I like it because it makes me feel free, independent and happy.

I have always felt comfortable as a child with my tank mates. During these years I have changed three times around pools. At the moment I am training at the Turin Sisport near Mirafiori. Is a sport quite tiring but you can relax when the coach says it's time to take a break. If I had to give advice to someone who wants starting this sport I would tell him not to worry if he doesn't feel confident. If he was afraid of the water it is not recommended to practice this sport, or be able to break down his fear would be a great goal. All in all I would recommend to anyone to play this sport. It is a sport that purifies and regenerates you.</s>", "Friendship today Friendship is actually a really important issue nowadays. Plenty of ways can be used to make new friends.

It influenced the further development of post-Soviet countries as well geopolitical situation in the whole world. It has also influenced the international relations not just within post-Soviet area, but also in the entire world, as the period after the collapse of the USSR was marked as crash of bipolar structure of international relations. So long as for fifty years the world lived under the shadow of the Cold War, fearing a fatal confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union, the dissolution of the USSR had a huge resonance not only in the US mass-media but also in the American society. American press had widely illustrated the revolution in the Baltic States and the tension which has been spread in the Soviet Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall as well as the fall of communist governments within the whole former Soviet Bloc. The tensions in the Soviet Union came to its peak in August 1991, while Gorbachev was on vacation in the Crimea, a group of right wing military and KGB leaders staged a coup in Moscow.

The main reason is the convenience of travelling by cars in comparison with using public transport. Apart from that, there are many other benefits in buying a car instead of using buses or underground every day. First of all, an automobile gives such a valuable thing as privacy. For example, driving a car we can wear whatever we want and listen to the music on any volume. If the car is large enough, it can be even a perfect place for sleep. Additionally, if we are eager to travel outside the town in order to have some rest from a hectic rhythm of life, it will be more comfortable for us to use our cars. Only our own vehicle can provide us with an opportunity to find any quiet and pleasant place outside the city. Public transport can take us just to certain locations. Thus, it is clear that private transport such as automobiles has plenty of advantages. On the other hand, we can stuck with different problems while travelling by car. For instance, staying in traffic jams always steals much our precious time. Car accidents are the typical reason for this phenomenon. It means that travelling by cars can even be more dangerous than using public transport. Generally, bus drivers are much more experienced than automobile ones, therefore, accidents caused by public transport happen quite rarely. This makes travelling by public transport much safer. Thus, I would argue that driving a car requires much attention and understanding that careless behaviour on the road can make a serious damage to other people. In conclusion, I believe that public transport will eventually lose its dominance due to the fact that all people want to be independent and travel on their own. </s>", "In this essay I would like to highlight how a wide range of public transport can help people to save a bit of money and a lot of stressful hours stuck in the traffic jam. Firstly as everybody know the cost of the fuel is increasing more and more, adding to those the bill that own a car will bring, it became immediately clear that it is cheaper go around by public transport. Why then there still be so many people who prefer to drive their own car instead of seat comfortably on the train or on the tube reading their favorite book on their way to work? I would say that this is because the public transport are not so efficient as the should do. In my town for example, I have been Waiting for up to forty minutes before I could take a bus. I strongly believe that it is a shame because a lot of people like me would live their vehicles at home and take a train instead. Secondly, the environment would improve its state indeed, as far as I can see the pollution caused by the traffic is ruining monuments and making the air dirty and heavy, the same is as far as waste of time is concerned, obviously the fewer cars are around the quicker you can get where you want. In conclusion I would really like that politicians who care about public transport will improve the services so that more people could leave their vehicles at home and move around much more easily.</s>", "There is no future for public transport, becasue travelling by car is so much more convenient.

What happens to the rubbish The local government of Mi<unk>sk Mazowiecki has recently implemented new laws which concern rubbish segregation. It is obligatory for the inhabitants to put their different types of garbage into separate bins. Although citizens usually obey those rules, in some cases they are completely neglected. However, people who have bigger houses tend to compost the organic waste and that makes up for the disobedient. The situation with household litter looks much better rather than what happens on the streets of the city. Waste is thrown on the ground and very few people are concerned about this problem. Town's actions As not all inhabitants are sensitive about the environment, it is the local government's responsibility to decrease the harmful effects of people's actions. Authorities make sure that rubbish bins are placed in small distances since this is the most common reason why people throw litter on the ground. There are many workers employed so that the waste is picked up. Not also does it give job to people, but also has a good impact on the town's scenery.</s>", "Nowadays higher education becomes more and more necessary for starting a good career.

Some assert that genetically modified technology can be applied to address this problem. This essay will argue that genetically modified food can be the way out of the problem of food deficit and this will be done by focusing on its environmental benefits and increasing food yield. Firstly, GM food can have a positive impact on the problem of food safety. It is well known that the GM food is inserted with various resistance genes, such as pest disease resistance gene. This means that the food being more resistant to pests and agricultural diseases can minimise the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers that can poison the water supply and pollute the environment. This reduction in the application of chemical materials can create a safer agricultural environment, ensuring food safety. Furthermore, GM food can also improve the production of crops. Due to the various new traits resulting from the GM technology, such as drought tolerance and salinity tolerance, GM food can ensure the food production in the period of drought. This could be important for food production, especially in developing countries. However, some may argue that it is also questionable whether GM food has a detrimental impact on human health. Actually, thousands of tests on GM food, before bring it into markets, have been proven that it is harmless to both the environment and human health. In conclusion, it is evident that GM food can increase food yields with the less use of chemicals. In views of this, it is reasonable to believe that GM food might be an ideal strategy to alleviate the problem of food shortage. However, because there are some disadvantages in GM technology which is being developed, it is also recommended that governments should give more importance to the management of GM food.</s>", "Hello Jane!

The plot is about a teenage girl who moves in with her mother to their dream house, which was next to a home where a horrible double homicide had taken place in. As soon as they move in, they hear the rumors of the incident: a little girl brutally murdered her parents in the middle of the night and disappeared, and the other child of the family recently moved in there. As the movie develops, it has lots of interesting turns that let the viewer form his/her own conclusions. I myself am a fan of horror movies, which are highly predictable, so it was a great satisfaction to see such a complex film. The end completely blew me away and I believe it was the best part of it. The acting was smooth and credible. Although it had bad critics, the movie was well received by the audience; not to mention Jennifer Lawrence's appearance right after the hit of Hunger Games was great for advertising. In conclusion, I highly recommend this film for those who like drama and plot twists. </s>", "With no doubt all parents want their children to be citizen models. However raising a child into a model citizen is extremely hard - working. Some people think that this job should be done by the parents and others think unfairly that this is the teacher's responsibility. On one hand, parents should take responsibility on their children education as they are a child's first contact. Also, parents are like models to follow for their children, and as children do what they see they will copy their parents actions. Indeed school is the first place where a children interacts with society. However, they will talk or build a relationship based on what they see their parents doing with other people. Ultimately, teachers may have different values from the ones of the parents. On the other hand, parents may have lack of time to spend with their children due to demanding jobs and to provide everything that their children need, for example pay for their children school. It can also be argued that children spend most of their time at school and not at home, making the school responsibility to pass good social values. But it should not be forgotten, that parents have the most influence as they are models to follow. To sum up, parents should take full responsibility for their children education. However, one should take into account that a school with similar values to the ones of the parents would be a great help in the children raising process.</s>", "I think every people love sport.

For example, while women think about millions of things like what they want to do or have to do during the day, while men just do not think about anything and can be like that for hours with a blank mind.

In Korean, people must do military service for at least 2 years. Similarly, people do it for 1 year in Taiwan. There is a debate about whether everyone should do military service when they reach 18 years old. The supporters maintain that it is important for national security and makes people more mature, whilst the opponents claim that military service affects study and should have freedom of choice. Firstly, every country needs military defense must be protected by a stronger armed forces for national security. If a war or other dangerous threat to the safety of the country, they cannot get help from other countries immediately. Therefore, people completing military service could protect their country more easily. In particular, a small population of a country has a policy that people need to do military service in order to develop into a powerful country. Secondly, being more mature when they complete military service is important, which probably is a particular experience for 18-year-olds. In addition to hard physical training and acquiring different special skills, people also improve their personal qualities as a result of doing military service. Consequently, people seem to be more                             and stronger than other people who do not complete military service. In contrast, the opponents of military service point out that studying is the first vital thing for people when they reach 18 years old. Military service mainly improves physical fitness, whereas study might be completed better in school at the age because it has a professional teaching staff and a good study environment, people usually concentrate easier on learning knowledge. For instance, some countries allow people to do military service after all their courses are finished. In addition, critics argue that countries should allow people more freedom of choice regarding military service. \n  \n  some people are unwilling to do military service, people volunteer for military service potentially enjoy it. Furthermore, respect for the rights of people, especially for women who are unable to withstand the hard training, must also be ensured.

One of the strengths of the film is its star-studded cast: Juliette Binoche as Vianne, Alfred Molina as the mayor, Judi Dench as a grumpy old woman   \n  with the oppressive society of the village, and young Johnny Depp as a tall, handsome gypsy arriving in town with his caravan. Each and every role is beautifully written and the actors don\u2019t fail at bringing them to life. Besides the cast, I would like to highlight the original soundtrack. It harmonizes perfectly with the theme of the movie, with a little bit of jazz manouche, a popular genre amongst European gypsy communities, and references to Mexican folklore, as the recipes Vianne Rocher prepares in the \u2018chocolaterie\u2019 are a heritage from her Maya ancestors. If I had to find a down side to Chocolat, it would be that the film format does not allow us to get a deeper look into some of the characters and their storylines. Had it been written today, instead of in the year 2000, I am sure that this story would have been turned into a successful TV series in which we could have learnt more about the past and the future of those fantastic characters. All in all, this is a gripping, moving, and entertaining film that will make you reflect on some social issues. A must-see if, like me, you enjoy cinema with strong female characters in the leading roles, but you do not necessarily want to watch another dramatic story. </s></s>\n", "Nowadays, students have a wide variety of forms of education. They may not only learn at school but also through the Internet. It has both advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage of learning on the Internet is time-saving. When we attend school, we often waste time on the buses going to and from school, which we might intend to use for studying. In the case of Internet learning, we can set our own hours for learning. Also, the possibility of learning at home is a big advantage, especially for people who prefer peace and quiet. Then it is better to concentrate on learning and we don't feel any pressure or stress connected with answering questions and taking tests. On the other hand, through long-term Internet learning we could feel bored or lonely. School provides an opportunity to learn in a group when students can help each other and solve problems. Another disadvantage of learning on the Internet can be an issue with the Internet connection. It does not always work correctly. </s></s>\n", "The social debate between progress and tradition has been going on for centuries. Through our customs, we celebrate our past and keep our cultural heritage alive. But it is also because of this set of beliefs, mostly of religious origin, that some societies fail to evolve and respond to the ever-changing needs of all of their people. One of the main advantages of cultural practices is that they allow societies to maintain their identities and achieve economic stability. In most Latin American countries, millennial practices such as silversmithing not only keep the region in touch with its heritage, but they have become the sole source of income for many communities. Nations like Mexico and Peru, with internationally recognized cuisines, have taken advantage of their culinary roots and boosted the production of locally grown foods, like chipotle peppers and quinoa, to bring economic growth to their agricultural sectors. On the other hand, the greatest disadvantage of traditions, is that religious beliefs have kept these very same populations from social and human rights progress. Gay marriage and reproductive rights are not recognized by the government of Costa Rica and most Latin American governments because of the set of beliefs of a percentage of their community. In conclusion, traditions should be cherished and kept alive for future generations. However, the safekeeping of these practices should never become a priority over the well-being of the collective. Progress and tradition are not opposites in a society where respect and tolerance for others is the priority. </s></s>\n", "My favourite sport is badminton and I always get up early to play it every day.

An example of an intervention in airway management is the face mask that Mr. Sharma was using. Also, this practice is the primary consideration for efficient post-operative care (Scoot, 2012). The majority of patients that have had general anaesthesia, like Mr. Sharma, must recover in a PACU (Post Anaesthesia Care Unit) to monitor the vital signs, especially airway management due to the anaesthesia, which can lead to postoperative complications (Scoot, 2012; Farrell & Dempsey, 2011). Over the first 24 hours after surgery, the period is considered the most critical period because the patient can present primarily with lung disorders, and the nurse needs to maintain cardio-respiratory stability (Popov & Peniche, 2009). Addressing the airway management after Mr. Sharma came to the PACU, the first procedure that the nurse should do is follow the A-G assessment protocol to review the stability and the airway patency of the patient, sustaining pulmonary ventilation to prevent hypoxemia and hypercapnia (Farrell & Dempsey, 2010). Mr. Sharma's airway should be clear and free of mucus or blood (Pudner, 2010). Due to the surgery, Mr Sharma is in a supine position, but this position reduces his oxygenation (Snowball, 2012), and can also impede airflow related to the anaesthetic effect, where the tongue and lower jaw fall backward. Hence, he needs oxygen supply to prevent any airway obstruction. Therefore, oxygen therapy needs to continue immediately along with his admission, via nasal cannula or oxygen mask at 4 to 6L/min, until the anaesthetic effects are completely gone and the patient's oxygen saturation is restored (Farrell & Dempsey, 2010). Thus, Mr. Sharma was given O2 via Hudson mask 6L/min because he received general anaesthesia and all of his muscles were relaxed, at the moment, he did not have control over his reflexes (Farrell & Dempsey, 2010).

A good illustration of this would be children. One child whose parents come from different countries is able to learn two languages at the same time.

On the other hand, if you go abroad, you will be able to improve your English in an anglophone country, in this case, your knowledge will be reinforced by your stay there. To sum up, if you want to learn English, you don't need to go abroad, you can improve your English by working hard inside your own country, for example, by doing exercises like listening and writing, or you can meet with native people who speak English to practise with them.

The car is more comfortable than public transport but is not sustainable, the cost is higher and if all people used cars, the cities would be very polluted.

Other forms of transport that could be very useful in the future are the bike, this form of transport is cheap and environmentally friendly, also, more and more cities are building a lot of bike lanes, so it is a good alternative. For travelling between cities or towns, in my opinion, the car will remain the most widely used form of transport, although the new modes of transport could change this situation.

Their transformation from innocent posters to digital screens ranging in size from miniscule to vast has made adverts all-pervasive. Researchers say that an average adult in the developed world is now exposed to hundreds of commercial messages every day. Those involved in this lucrative business are in awe of the almost endless possibilities that recent technological advances offer them. Multimedia advertising and entertainment companies now work in synergy to target everyone from toddlers who can barely speak to pensioners confused by the speed of life in the new age, unsubtly playing on their needs and desires in order to turn them all into faithful consumers. They have so successfully infiltrated their own product into our everyday existence that we no longer see it anymore as what it really is: a nuisance.

The result is insincere, misleading and often deceptive messages that our minds are saturated with.

Fame is a choice of many people, it was their dream. But it doesn't mean they don't have some rights to have a private life. Many of them have family members who don't want anything in common with fame. Usually the journalists also follow them all the time. It's very important to remember if you're famous, you should protect your family. Sometimes journalists write some silly                     about famous people which are not true. It can be a danger for the family of a celebrity, a politician, a famous person because, through them, some couples could break up. But on the other hand, being famous is a free choice for many people. They want to be rich and famous and they know that the journalists will follow them. But sometimes it doesn't depend on us. If you're a member of the royal family from your birth you'll be observed by the press and magazines, it's a price of being famous. Though it doesn't mean that the press should write about privacy, public activity is one of the most important things. rbrack]", "I work at a gas station.

Therefore, some people claim that the social trend is tending to reduce the popularity of travelling by public transport. As a result, this development is highly controversial in positive and negative ways. </s></s>\n", "Introduction The aim of this proposal is to present suggestions regarding the ways in which the extra funding could be used to benefit the students and, indirectly, the local community. Needless to say, in order to combat the rising tide of social problems in Hampshire, the Education Authority decided to increase funds for the educational sector. Sports Club Physical activities might improve the overall condition of the students and for this reason they are necessary. It is well known that physical activity contributes to improving physical and mental health. Drama Club This kind of club will allow students to express their feelings in a non-violent manner, learn how to manage their reactions and develop creative talent. A drama club will make examining plays such as Shakespeare's more enjoyable than solely studying them, alone. Cookery classes Cookery classes are very important because the students here are young adults that need basic skills such as cooking in order to manage on their own and live an independent life. Cooking classes will help students spend less money on eating out and they will start eating healthier because by making their own food, they will be more aware of what they are eating. DIY Classes \"Do it yourself\" classes improve practical skills. As most college students soon leave for university and live in dorms without their parents, they are obligated to solve mechanical problems on their own. The information they acquire during these courses will help them for the rest of their lives. Citizenship classes Another kind of class that is necessary are citizenship classes because today's teenagers are deficient in this area. These courses will develop the civic sense of the students and they will start actively engaging in society. Conclusion The overall purpose of these actions is to keep young adults in school and to educate them. The Education Authority believes that social problems are linked with a decrease in participation in extracurricular activities and suggests that the college should use extra funding to solve this issue. Organising clubs and courses such as the ones mentioned above would improve the situation, \n             .", "I'm Emad from Egypt.

Then, he taught me how to play, for example, when hitting the ball, used the strength of the whole arm and did not just use the elbow, or you would feel tired very quickly.

Some people think that knowing facts is more easily and practical. Nevertheless, others consider learning ideas and concepts is the best way to solve many academic and real-life problems. In my view, l completely agree with the idea that it is more important for students to learn ideas and concepts than learn facts, I would like to give my reasons. First, learning facts can help students solve one kind of problem that they may encounter. However, ideas and concepts give people a competitive advantage in dealing with similar issues. For example, once, I did not understand an idea that my teacher explained in class, but just remember facts. When I did my homework, the problem was different than the one discussed in the class, whereas, I went back to my textbook and tried to understand the ideas and concepts. I easily worked out the problem. From this experience, I learned that I not just remember facts, but try my best to understand ideas and concepts, thus, I can solve many kinds of problem easily. Second, learning ideas and concepts greatly supports self-education. Consequently, you can reach high academic levels. It is easy to learn facts from people around you. However, learning ideas and concepts requires more investigation and understanding many of the academic textbooks. Nowadays, there is limited time for any teacher to cover all the points on a certain subject. When students grasp an idea of any topic, it will be easy to understand all issues related to it deeply. For instance, when I was in the senior year of high school, I took a physics class. There was a massive amount of information on a specific issue, but l tried my best to understand its concept that helped me identify unmentioned points. In sum, absorbing ideas and facts is the most effective strategy. Not only do students learn more in their studying, but also they help students better understand many facts in our life than any other ways. </s></s>\n", "This review is to tell you about the Astoux restaurant, which is situated in the heart of Cannes on the seashore.

After joining ACU (Australian Catholic University), I found vast differences in teaching method between Nepal and Australia. In Nepal, students study individually, and they do not ask questions of the teacher even if they are confused. In contrast, Australian education is based on teaching students new skills. Students need to actively participate in discussion with their peers. In addition, students are able to ask questions of the lecturer because they are able to express their opinion. At first, I felt stressed while studying in groups and used to be hesitant while sharing my ideas and opinion, but now I am familiar with the academic culture. The academic culture is a challenge for many students in effective learning. Peer learning is a small group of three to five students kept together to discuss the content and carry out educational activities in mutual engagement. (Fisher, as cited in Strake, 2010, p.2), Peer learning is a two-way learning process in which group members feel more at ease discussing the content. It helps to understand the importance of group work by giving and receiving feedback on particular tasks. According to Hamp (2002), the goal of the EAP (English for Academic Purposes) course is to teach students relevant study skills they need throughout their degree. It helps to share ideas, knowledge, among the students and makes them think critically by using formal language while writing, etc. In conclusion, the adoption of the Australian academic culture has developed strategies for my learning. I have become an independent learner and started to ask questions, share my opinion with the tutor. In the future, I will improve learning strategies by actively working in a group. </s></s>\n", "Sport is very good for our health. I would like to play football because it is such an exciting game.

Also, travelling, of course, that's a big part of the function of the car!

It seems more convenient to them to travel alone rather than on public transport. It can be argued that the public transport system is losing in popularity in many ways. People feel that they can get to their destinations on time if they drive their own car. It is true in many cases because public transport like buses, trains and trams have their own specific routes and stops. This can cause people to arrive late at their particular destination. Secondly, public transport becomes more expensive day by day, which has reduced its popularity. People therefore find cars more affordable for them. In modern society, the cost of buying a car has become cheaper, which in turn has helped make it easier for people to buy a car. Moreover, many car finance companies have made it easy for every individual to purchase a car. In conclusion, i would say that, as a result of recent advances in society, there has been a considerable increase in the ownership of cars.

I will provide you with some pieces of advice about shopping for clothes in the city as well as some recommendations. Fashion and luxury In the city there are many fashion shops where you can get the most trendy clothes. You must be aware that maybe you will spend more money than expected, but if you are a shopaholic, it will be worth it. NANY'S has party dresses and wonderful shoes that you can wear on special occasions. You will fall in love with them because they are \n         coloured. In addition, they often have discounts and offers, so you can get some bargains if you shop in the accessories.

Clothes at a low price Every Monday there is a street market in the central square. In spite of the fact that they are not new clothes, they are usually trendy and of good quality. If the idea of a street market does not seduce you, I recommend you visit the a little shop on Saint Peter street called The Old Bag, where you can buy bags and other accessories such as umbrellas, gloves and scarves. In addition, the shop is very cheap and you can have a cup of coffee inside while you are shopping. Recommendations If you are a fashion lover, you should visit Linda and Nany's.

This group had a leader called Mario Casas played by Antonio Banderas. The film is well-developed and shows the audience every little issue and difficulty that the miners had to go through. However, the first 17 days of the movie could get a bit tedious because the director focused on every single feeling of the trapped men and their families. After that lapse, the rescuers found the place where the miners were hiding and the moment for rescuing them started. The characters were perfect as soon as they were people from Chile and Bolivia that were involved in the real accident. Antonio Banderas did excellent work acting as a desperate leader committed to the local people.

In addition, I will recommend the best kind of advertising for our needs. First, to have a successful campaign, it is important to know the target market. A survey about the kind of customers for our product revealed that most of them are young adults. This means that they are between 20 and 30 years old. After studying our advertising options, it was found that two of them are suitable for our purpose. One way is to put advertising on the internet and use social networks. On the other hand, we can set up stands in shopping malls. In order to derive the maximum benefit from this, it will be helpful if we give away product samples. As I mentioned above, the advertising campaign must be appropriate to the target market. I therefore feel justified in recommending that the campaign in the shopping malls will be more effective for us. This is mainly because, in addition to being cheaper, the customers will become familiar with the product. In conclusion, we have different options for this campaign. If we choose the appropriate kind of advertising for our product, I can assure you that we will succeed. </s></s>\n", "There is no future for public transport is one of the worst things in our life.

The study pointed out that the public transportation network in the United States has not been expanded for a long time compared to the situation in Germany, for example.

Many reasons cause research to be extremely difficult. As a result, there is the debate over whether educational institutes have a responsibility to discourage students from pursuing a field of study in which they are unlikely to succeed. In my opinion, the statement is true for the following reasons. Admittedly, some of the research requires a large investment of resources that educational institutes cannot afford. Such research will indeed fail. Educational institutes should discourage students. However, if there is not a lack of the resources for the field of study, educational institutes should support students working in their area of study. Education\u2019s greatest purpose is to encourage students to attempt learning from failure. Take, for example, Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the light bulb. He tried a lot of different materials to make the filament for the light bulb. Once, people thought he would succeed. Even though the research really could not succeed, students can learn some things from the course of the research. In the course of the research, students learn how to develop the process of the research and know which aspect will cause the problem making the research fail. In addition, students on the course of the research maybe create serendipity. Like Alexander Fleming, the inventor of the antibiotic, discovered penicillin accidentally during the research on a germ. \"You must do the thing you think you cannot do,\" said by Eleanor Roosevelt. The invaluable thing is turning the impossible into the possible.

For example, researchers have found that belly fat is related to alcohol consumption, second, alcohol can cause some serious health issues, especially cirrhosis of the liver, heart failure, brain damage, and various cancers, third, alcohol users are more likely to be aggressive and violent.

Maybe most of us spent our childhood with our cousins and they were our best friends for ages. Siblings are another strong piece of evidence supporting this statement. It is usual to hear that this kind of bond is the strongest within a family because everybody thinks that siblings are the only ones with whom you can truly rely on, even though that is not always true.

In conclusion, from my point of view, it is true that it is less likely to feel negative feelings within the family like envy, resentment or hatred. So, if you tell a secret to your sister or your cousin, it is almost certain that they aren't going to spread it. Even if you look for good advice, some members of your family could help you from the heart. But the family does not always guarantee these functions nor does friendship.

Pets and animals in general need fresh air and exercise outside and not always being in an apartment.

The number of these people is increasing not just in  developing countries but all over the world. In my opinion, homeless people are victims because nobody wants to live without a shelter. First of all, being without a home is a horrible problem. One of the major reasons for this problem is war especially in the Arab countries like Syria, Libya and Yemen. Every day on the news we see refugees in a miserable condition. They live in tents that do not protect them from cold weather or dangerous insects. They do not have enough food. In addition, the financial crisis, almost all  companies have a financial problem, so the ideal solution for them is downsizing. After a while, the people who are laid off will not have enough money to live on, and they will become homeless. Furthermore, poverty is a result of family problems. Cases of divorce are increasing and many children run away and prefer to live on the streets instead of in a home full of problems. Contrary to the above, some people believe that homeless people are criminals and they cause danger in our society because they need money and food so they can steal or kill for that reason. To conclude, the world has a complicated issue, so the governments and  charitable organizations must make a quick decision and develop a real solution to solve this problem. The homeless people are human beings and they must enjoy their rights in life. </s></s>\n", "Dear Paul, Last month, as you may know, I was a volunteer at the concert by my favourite band in Katowice.

This leads to different views on whether the best things to improve people's lives have already happened. I hold the belief that the topic for me is completely wrong even though some improvements are easy to use and solve most of the problems. First, the population continues to grow, the space for living is a serious problem although the skyscraper easily solved the biggest problems caused by the population crisis. On the other hand, the skyscraper creates more problems, such as pollution. For example, I designed a                                in a very densely populated city in Taiwan. The skyscraper provides more space for an excess population; however, the building generates more pollution when the skyscraper is constructed using modern materials, such as steel and concrete. They cause damage to the environment when the raw materials are dug out of the site. The pollution must harm the local people and the environment near the site of the raw materials. This is why I mentioned that the problem still exists and the problem only moves to another region and type. Second, the computer system looks like it solves most of the problems; however, this system is more dangerous in specific situations. The \"BUG\" must appear from a man-made system because of incomplete coding. That is why our personal information is always leaked by the \"hacker\". For instance, when we enjoy electronic commercial services and shop for goods on the Internet, the hacker may steal private information at the same time. They will use that information to cheat people out of their money on the phone and you will trust them because of the correct personal information. This is a normal phenomenon in Taiwan; however, the police cannot do anything because of the hacker's anonymity.

The number of people using public transport far outweighs the number of people the transport system was designed to handle.

Also, the increase in disposable income has given more buying power to consumers. Both of these factors have led to an increased purchase of cars over the last few years. This trend is likely to continue in the near future. Public transport cannot compete with the sheer mobility that cars offer to their owners. Cars have the ability to take you from your home to your place of work without any stops. If you have to take a train, you have to get to the train station on foot, take a taxi, or take a bus. Furthermore, after you get off the train, you again have to find your way to your destination either on foot or using another mode of transport. Cars make it easier to transport children and luggage.

I really enjoyed reading your blog about shadowing students. I like the way you gave examples of how you felt and how you would change your own lessons. I live in the Netherlands and at our school it is the same. Our pupils have to sit for many hours a day, and they find it hard to sit still and to be silent. I also think that a lesson went well if they didn\u2019t talk and did their work. However, when I was reading your article, I felt ashamed due to the fact that when every teacher teaches the way I do it is logical that our students cannot be quiet and cannot sit without making a movement. Moreover, when we as teachers have a study day, I get tired myself by sitting all day. Your key takeaway #3 was shocking for me; the feeling of being a nuisance is dreadful. In my opinion, I am very patient and willing to explain difficult topics over and over again. I really hope my students feel the same, otherwise I have to change my attitude! I get paid for being a teacher and, as I see it, it is my job to clarify and help my pupils to understand. Your experience gave me food for thought especially when you wrote that our pupils are sitting passively and listening during approximately 90 per cent of their classes. I am going to look at my lessons again to see if I can change those lessons and try to motivate my pupils to be more active. I teach at Beginners General level and I have already started to use some activities where they must use an iPad and make pictures or short films. For example, my pupils had to learn the difference between this and that and I let them make a short film about pointing at things at school saying: this door, that window, this is my teacher, that is a chair. However, I find it difficult to use activities every lesson because they are time consuming. The main reason that prevents me from using them, however, are my colleagues. I don\u2019t see them doing activities, it looks as if they are just doing their lessons and want to use a book and that is it. For instance, when I hear that another English teacher finished Unit 5 and I am still at Unit 4, I feel inadequate. It gives me the feeling that the most important thing about teaching is doing all the exercises in the book and getting all the work done. Maybe you understand this.", "Hello, my name is Sara and I'm a twenty-seven-year-old half-Italian, half-Spanish seventeen-year-old girl with a really cheerful, energetic and hardworking personality.

I love children and it wouldn't be annoying for me to take care of a group of little monsters and organize sports and activities for them. Actually, I think I would really enjoy it and my day would end up with a tired smile, but a very bright smile. I've never had any experience of this kind before, but I have a brother three years younger than me and a seven-year-old little cousin with whom I used to play a lot when I didn't have to study, and because it's a summer camp and I don't have homework to do, I would put my whole self into this job. I am constantly brainstorming to find everything that could be challenging for me, and usually try to follow what my mind comes up with, so I think I could come up with nice ideas for those children. I started cooking when I was fourteen years old, but I'm better at baking, so I could help preparing some sweets for the children. They would obviously be as healthy as possible, and I would be really careful of those children with allergies, and try to bake something that also they could eat.

First, this kind of advertising should be forbidden on the basis of the fact that young children are still very vulnerable. Kids around this age (2 to 5 years old) do not have a mature critical sense and anything can easily persuade them. For instance, when I was three years old, I used to be captivated by all the toys which were presented on TV commercials just because of the way they were shown. One of them was \"the ultimate max steel\" which cost about a hundred dollars. Secondly, I am also opposed to the allowance of this kind of advertisement because of the extremely harmful consequences it has for the parents and the children's relationships. It is common we see parents having issues with their kids as a result of this kind of commercial. Many parents have an unhealthy relationship, or even a ruined relationship, with their kids. One example is what happened with my cousin Patricia when she had her first child called Sophia. One day, Sophia got really excited about an advertisement about the barbie doll and she could not think about anything else but getting this toy. Unfortunately, my cousin did not have enough money to buy it, but her three-year-old daughter did not understand it and got angry with Patricia, behaving badly with her for three weeks! In conclusion, I strongly endorse this statement. Advertising aimed at young kids, not only until 5 but until 8 years old, should be forbidden on the basis of the children's vulnerability and the risk to their parents' relationships with them. In the last case, if the advertisements were still broadcast, it would be essential some educational policies were introduced with them to teach and \r\n        kids about understanding their parents.</s></s>\n", "If you have a car, you would probably think that travelling by car is better than by bus, but a lot of people don't have a car so they are used to travelling by bus and for them, this mode of travel has become more convenient because they have done it since they were children.

First of all, Spanish educational laws are in Europe, and probably in the world, the only ones which have changed the most in the last 30 years. This fact makes the teachers uncertain of what they are doing. Besides, there are no results that can be analysed or checked. Secondly, there are two sorts of schools in Spain, public and private, which produce a big difference in educational knowledge. While public ones must obey governmental laws strictly, private schools have some privileges. Knowing this about the Spanish education system, we can now talk about technology. Obviously, agree that nowadays technology is necessary. So, the schools and the educational institutions in general have to update the way they teach. Technology does not mean a new instrument to be taught but a new tool and a source of knowledge (if used correctly). In fact, using technology without changing the contents would be a total failure. Teachers must learn how to use these new technological devices in order to get their students motivated. Moreover, they should combine the old information with the new. Thus, this would help students know how the world has evolved and how it will be. In other words, technology should be used as a tool for the students to be aware of the development of society and its advantages and disadvantages. New technologies also help with teaching development. We can have dynamic classes by being in contact with other schools. In the case of subjects such as English and French, students improve their skills by being in contact with students from different countries. Also, teachers could replace their methodologies following the best ones and the ones which contribute to having qualified students trained to face everyday life situations. In conclusion, as a great teacher said, we have 21st century students learning with 20th century tools using 19th century knowledge.

For example, if they see drunk or dirty people on public buses, they could avoid sitting near them or reporting them to the bus driver. Second, it is a good opportunity to educate them in life skills such as knowing not to sit inreserved seats or leave rubbish on the bus. In contrast, I think that the parents who insist their children should only travel on school buses protect them too much. In daily life, many young people need to go to school and back on public transportation. In other words, if parents spoil their children then they may become too dependent and incapable of functioning well in society later on. In conclusion, it is not only a good chance to take the children on an adventure, but also helps them become independent young adults. I think this way can help them adapt to society early on. </s></s>\n", "My favourite sport is swimming. I like it because it makes me feel free, independent and happy. It is an individual sport but also a team activity. In my opinion it is one of the healthiest sports because you can train not only your body but you can also develop your breathing. I did not start swimming in competitions until almost from the age of 3. I always had great coaches who trained me according to my ability so that I did not go beyond my limits. I have always felt comfortable as a child with my teammates. During these years, I have changed swim clubs three times. At the moment, I train at the Turin Sisport near Mirafiori. It is a quite tiring sport but you can relax when the coach says it's time to take a break. If I had to give advice to someone who wants to start this sport, I would tell him not to worry if he does not feel confident. If he is afraid of the water, it is not recommended to do this sport, or being able to overcome his fear would be a great goal. All in all, I would recommend this sport to anyone.

It influenced the further development of post-Soviet countries as well as the geopolitical situation in the the whole world. It also influenced international relations not just within the post-Soviet area, but throughout the entire world, as the period following the collapse of the USSR was marked by the collapse of the bipolar structure of international relations. For fifty years, the world lived under the shadow of the Cold War, fearing a fatal confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union, the dissolution of the USSR had a huge resonance not only in the American mass-media, but also in American society. The American press widely covered the revolution in the Baltic States and the tension which was spread throughout the Soviet Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall, as well as the collapse of communist governments throughout the former Soviet Bloc. The tensions in the Soviet Union reached their peak in August 1991, while Gorbachev was on vacation in the Crimea, a group of right wing military and KGB leaders staged a coup in Moscow. The \"New York Times\" published a series of articles dedicated to the coup. They were published under the common title \"Soviet crisis\".

The main reason is the convenience of travelling by car in comparison with using public transport. Apart from that, there are many other benefits to buying a car instead of using the subway or bus every day. First of all, a car gives such a valuable thing as privacy. For example, driving a car, we can wear whatever we want and listen to music at any volume. If the car is large enough, it can even be a perfect place to sleep. Additionally, if we are eager to travel outside the town in order to have some rest from the hectic rhythm of life, it will be more comfortable for us to use our car. Only our own vehicle can provide us with an opportunity to find any quiet and pleasant place outside the city. Public transport takes us only to certain locations. Thus, it is clear that private transport such as automobiles has plenty of advantages. On the other hand, we can encounter different problems while travelling by car. For instance, being in traffic jams always robs much of our precious time. Car accidents are the typical cause of this problem. It means that travelling by car can even be more dangerous than using public transport. Generally, bus drivers are much more experienced than car drivers, therefore, accidents caused by public transport occur quite rarely. This makes travelling by public transport much safer. Thus, I would argue that driving a car requires much attention and understanding that careless behaviour on the road can cause serious damage to other people. In conclusion, I believe that public transport will eventually lose its dominance due to the fact that all people want to be independent and travel on their own. </s></s>\n", "In this essay, I would like to emphasize how a wide range of public transport can help people to save a bit of money and a lot of stressful hours stuck in traffic jams. Firstly, as everybody knows, the cost of fuel is increasing more and more, added to the expense of owning a car, it became immediately clear that it is cheaper to get around on public transport. Why then are there still so many people who prefer to drive their own car instead of sit comfortably on the train or on the tube reading their favorite book on the way to work? I would say that this is because the public transport is not as efficient as it should be. In my town, for example, I have been waiting up to forty minutes before I could take a bus. I strongly believe that it is a shame because a lot of people like me avoid driving their vehicles to and from work and take the train instead.

Some assert that genetically modified technology can be applied to address this problem. This essay will argue that genetically modified food can be the way out of the problem of food deficit and this will be done by focusing on its environmental benefits and increased crop yield. Firstly, GM food can have a positive impact on the problem of food safety. It is well known that GM food is engineered with various resistance genes, such as a pest disease resistance gene. This means that food that is more resistant to pests and agricultural diseases can minimise the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers that can poison the water supply and pollute the environment. This reduction in the application of chemical materials can create a safer agricultural environment, ensuring food safety. Furthermore, GM food can also improve the production of crops. Due to the various new traits resulting from the GM technology, such as drought tolerance and salinity tolerance, GM food can ensure food production during a period of drought. This could be important for food production, especially in developing countries. However, some may argue that it is also questionable whether GM food has a detrimental impact on human health. In fact, thousands of tests on GM food before it is brought to the market have been proven to be harmless to both the environment and human health. In conclusion, it is clear that GM food can increase food yields with less use of chemicals. In light of this, it is reasonable to believe that GM food might be an ideal strategy to alleviate the problem of food shortage. However, because there are some disadvantages to GM technology that are being developed, it is also recommended that governments give more importance to the management of GM food. </s></s>\n", "Hello Jane! Here is a picture from the last summer when we were in Haland on an island called Nidingen! My name is Lorin and I am 13 years old. I live in Djursholm at Riddarv\u00e4gen 42, close to a park. I was born on August 4 at the hospital in Danderyd. In my family there are five of us, my mom is Malak, my dad is Claes, my little sister is Novalie and my little brother is Edvard. Novalie is 10 years old and Edvard is 6 years old. In my spare time, I like to be with friends and I also play soccer, dance and ski. I really like doing sports because I like being outside. I compete in skiing and I think it is very fun. I often go skiing in <unk>, Vemdalen and in Ramundberget. Once every year, I ski with my ski club (T\u00e4by slalomklubb) in Switzerland. In Switzerland we went to Saas fee and Zermatt. In Zermatt, you can see the Matterhorn (the mountain that you see on the Toblerone wrapper). It is a very cool mountain. I also go skiing with my family and that is the best. I like slalom because it goes fast and I like the snow. In the summer holidays, my family and I just go to the west coast at a small island called K<unk>lhuvudet. That is one of our summerhouses. I love going there because when we are there, we swim in the ocean and catch crabs and have a really good time. Of course, you can see the ocean and it is very beautiful. Something else I like doing is shopping. My parents call me a shopaholic and I almost agree. I like it because it is fun to look at clothes and try them on. I read a lot and my favourite book is Harry Potter. I like fantasy and that book is fantastic. If it were possible to go to Hogwarts, I would. Now you know what my favourite book is so you can almost guess what my favorite movie is... Of course, Harry Potter. But I also like a movie called The game plan.

These are some advantages such as it is more comfortable and faster when you travel by bus, compared with travelling by car. Also, travelling by car does impose more schedule, and it is less comfortable than travelling by car. However, when you travel by car, you can go whenever you want. Sometimes private transport is cheaper if you travel with other people. For example, when you travel by car, you can ride with other people so you use less gas, On the other hand, private transport damages the planet because we must take care of the planet. We can help to reduce pollution of the environment if we take public transport that does not pollute. At the moment, there are more than one car per person, and that is a problem for me because people do not take care of the environment. They prefer comfort.

As soon as they move in, they hear the rumors about the incident: a little girl brutally murdered her parents in the middle of the night and disappeared, and the other child in the family recently moved in there. As the movie develops, it has lots of interesting turns that let the viewer draw his/her own conclusions. I myself am a fan of horror movies that are highly predictable, so it was great satisfaction to see such a complex film. The ending completely blew me away and I believe it was the best part of it. The acting was smooth and credible.

However, raising a child to be a good citizen is extremely hard work. Some people think that this responsibility belongs to the parents and others think incorrectly that it is the teacher's responsibility. On the one hand, parents should take responsibility for their children's education as they are a child's first contact. Also, parents are like models for their children to emulate, and because children do what they see, they will copy their parents' actions. Indeed, school is the first place where a child interacts with society. However, they will talk or build a relationship based on what they see their parents doing with other people. Ultimately, the teachers may have different values from those of the parents. On the other hand, parents may lack time to spend with their children due to demanding jobs and providing everything that their children need, for example, paying for their children's schooling. It can also be argued that most of the time children are at school and not at home, making the school responsible for passing on good social values. But it must not be forgotten that the parents have the most influence because they are the models to follow. To sum up, parents should take full responsibility for their children's education. However, one should take into account that a school with similar values to those of the parents would be a great help in the child- rearing process. </s></s>\n", "I think everyone loves sport.

He was very jealous, but I thought it would fade away with time and with the gaining of trust, but it did not and ended up making me sick as the time passed.\nI learned that a man does anything to conquer a woman. He even does a lot of hateful things for him, such as going to her home every night to be together or to hang out, while later you find out that he hates going to places except his house. I learned a man says anything just to shut you up and not discuss things, just to have some love moments. He does not end an argument and give a position to understand your point, he thinks he is right and does not want to think about it.\nI also learned that men think in a different way from women during the day. For example, while women think about millions of things like what they want to do or have to do during the day, men just do not think about anything and can be like that for hours, just with a blank mind. But, in my opinion, this should be an excuse to think something that women shouldn't know anything about.\nI also learned that it is the mother that gives the principles and the direction of a man's mind, and depending on her, he is going to be a sexist or not, he is going to help and be an honorable man or not, he is going to be a good and caring father or not, he is going to be a responsible human being or not.

In Korea, people have to do military service for at least 2 years. Similarly, people have to do it for 1 year in Taiwan. There is debate about whether everyone should have to do military service when they reach 18 years old, with supporters maintaining that it is important for national security and makes people mature\uff0cwhilst opponents claim that military service has effects on people's studies and people should have freedom of choice.\n\nFirstly, every country requires stability and must be protected by strong armed forces for national security. If a war or other danger threatens the safety of a country they cannot get help from other countries immediately. Therefore\uff0cpeople accept that military service could be an easier way to protect their country. In particular, some countries with small populations have a policy that people need to do military service to develop into a powerful country. \nSecondly, it is important for people to become mature when they complete military service, which probably is a particular experience at 18 years old. In addition to having hard physical training and getting different special skills\uff0cpeople also can improve their personal qualities through military service. Consequently\uff0cpeople could be more independent and strong. They seem to become mature earlier than other people who do not do military service.\n\nIn contrast, opponents of military service point out that education is the first vital thing for people who reach 18 years old. Military service mainly improves physical fitness\uff0cbut education might be completed better in school at that age because it has a professional teacher team and a good study atmosphere\uff0cpeople usually find it easier to concentrate on learning knowledge. For instance, some countries allow people to do military service after all their courses have finished. \n\nAdditionally, critics argue that countries are able to allow people to have freedom of choice about military service. Some people are unwilling to do military service\uff0cwhile some people volunteer for military service and possibly enjoy it. Furthermore\uff0cit also can respect rights of people\uff0cespecially women who are not able to adapt to the hard training.  \n\nIn conclusion, it can be concluded that military service is necessary for national security and good for people to improve themselves.

The plot revolves around Vianne Rocher, a single mother and chocolate expert, opening a \u2018chocolaterie\u2019 right before Lent in a small, closed-minded French village, the mayor of which decides to boycott her. During Lent, the protagonist gets to know other outcasts (mainly women) and helps them.

Each and every one of the roles is beautifully written and the actors don\u2019t fail in bringing them to life. Besides the cast, I would like to highlight the original soundtrack. It suits perfectly the theme of the movie, with a little bit of jazz manouche, a popular genre amongst European gypsy communities, and reminiscences of Mexican folklore, as the recipes Vianne Rocher prepares in the \u2018chocolaterie\u2019 are a heritage from her Mayan ancestors.\n\nIf I had to find a downside to Chocolat, it would be that the film format does not allow us to have a deeper look into some of the characters and their story lines. Had it not been written in the year 2000, but today, I am sure that this story would have been turned into a successful TV series in which we could have learnt more about the past and the future of those fantastic characters.\n\nAll in all, this is a gripping, moving, and entertaining film that will make you reflect on some social issues.

Through our customs, we celebrate our past and keep our cultural heritage alive. But it is also because of these sets of beliefs, mostly of religious origins, that some societies fail to evolve and respond to the ever-changing needs of all of their people. \n\nOne of the main advantages of cultural practices is that they allow societies to maintain their identities and gain economic stability. In most Latin American countries, <unk> practices such as silversmithing, not only keep the region in touch with its heritage, but they have become the sole source of income for many communities. Nations like Mexico and Peru, with internationally recognized cuisines, have taken advantage of their culinary roots and boosted the production of locally grown foods, like chipotle peppers and quinoa, to bring economic growth to their agriculture sectors.  \n\nOn the other hand, the greatest disadvantage of traditions, is that religious beliefs have kept these very same populations from social and human rights progress. Gay marriage and reproductive rights are not recognized by the Costa Rican and most Latin governments, all because of the set of beliefs of a percentage of their community.\n\nIn conclusion, traditions should be cherished and kept alive for future generations. However, the safekeeping of these practices should never become a priority over the wellbeing of the collective. Progress and traditions are not opposites in a society where respect and tolerance for others is the priority.  ", "My favourite sport is badminton and I always get up early to play it every day.

So, humans, both women and men, should behave according to these points. The question which arises now is should the employer hire women for some posts and exclude them from others, and the same for men? \nThere are two answers to this question. The first one is from those who say that it is right to exclude women from some jobs. For example, a builder needs physical strength to carry cement and bricks. A mechanic should have the ability to deal with the drawbacks of the job. The second answer is that it is not correct to exclude men or women from any posts. The explanation of those who support the second answer is that everyone is born equal in terms of duties and rights.

He\u2019s one of AC-12\u2019s leading investigators although he sometimes has the tendency to let his personal feelings sway his professional judgement. Fleming plays his partner\u2019s role, an AC-12 undercover specialist, who prides herself on being the consummate professional, unmoved by emotional considerations. Both of them share a superior, Hastings, who remains the ethically upstanding senior investigating officer; zealous and suspicious, not being everyone's cup of tea. Even though  widely recognised for his impeccable ethical standards, he hides a drastic change in his personal circumstances.\n\nTheir scenes are repeatedly stolen, though, by the real stars of the show, the officers who are under suspicion of corruption: Lennie James (DCI Tony Gates) in the first season, and Keeley Hawes (DI Lindsay Denton) in the second one.\n\nWith calculated precision, the plot hatches a story where there are no goodies and baddies, and throws in a few twists and turns that make your jaw drop \u2014indeed, Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates has adopted a set of particular ethical principles and, nevertheless, he\u2019s adored by his loyal team, has got a nice family and has recently been awarded \u201cOfficer of the Year\u201d.\n\nTo conclude, those who ultimately felt miserable after the end of the spellbinding second season need not worry;  Line of Duty writer Jed Mercurio has been commissioned by the BBC to write the third and fourth series, and if", "Dear <unk>\n\nI found your advertisement in the newspaper and I am very interested in working in your summer camps.

For this, they must lead a healthy life. Outdoor games are made just for this purpose. That is, to make a person healthier.

Students have started to forget their physical games and get stuck in this internet world.

An example of an intervention in airway management is the ventilation mask that Mr. Sharma was using. Also, this practice is the primary consideration for  efficient post-anaesthesia care (Scoot, 2012).\nThe majority of patients that have had  general anaesthetic, like Mr. Sharma, must recover in a PACU (Post-anaesthesia Care Unit) to monitor the vital signs, especially the airways management due to the anaesthesia, impeding any postoperative complication (Scoot, 2012; Farrell & Dempsey, 2011). \nThe first 24 hours  post surgery is considered the most critical period, because the patient can present, primarily, lung disorders, and the nurse needs to maintain  cardio-respiratory stability (Popov & Peniche, 2009). \nAddressing the airway management after Mr. Sharma`s admission to PACU, the first procedure that the nurse should carry out, is follow the A-G assessment protocol, to review the stability and the airway <unk> of the patient, sustaining the pulmonary ventilation to prevent hypoxemia and hypercapnia  (Farrell & Dempsey, 2010). Mr. Sharma\u2019s airway should be <unk> and clear of mucus or blood (Pudner, 2010). Due to the surgery, Mr Sharma is in a supine position, but this position reduces his oxygenation (Snowball, 2012), and can also impede the air passage, This is related to the anaesthesia effect, where the tongue and the lower jaw fall backward. Hence, he needs oxygen supply to prevent any airway obstruction. \nTherefore, the oxygen therapy needs to continue immediately along with his admission, via nasal cannula or oxygen mask within 4 to 6L/min, until the anaesthesia effects are completely gone and the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation is restored  (Farrell & Dempsey, 2010). Thus, Mr. Sharma is being given O2 via Hudson mask 6L/min, because he received general anaesthesia and all of his muscles are relaxed and, at the moment, he does not have control over his reflexes (Farrell & Dempsey, 2010).

Ultimately, public transport will be negligible in the future.\n\nThere are so many reasons that could affect the public transport system. The main one is that nowadays people are incredibly busy with their day to day life, so that they don't like to spend their valuable time waiting for regular transport. Also, public transport causes lots of pollution which is harmful for human beings. For example, lunchtime travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emissions of carbon monoxide, which affects red blood cells and irritates the respiratory system. As a result, they prefer private transport systems to prevent such hazards. Finally, the public transport system is not always safe.

She\u00b4d cook the best tortilla, paella and all of the typical Spanish dishes  that I\u00b4ve ever eaten.\n\nA few years afterwards, right when I started high school and hit my teenager years, I began eating bigger amounts of unhealthy food from American fast food restaurants that I used to go to with my friends some days right  after class and during the weekends. Those years I was very familiar with the smell of cheeseburgers, BBQ pizzas  and  kebabs.\n\nBy the time my high school years were done, and  when I attended university, I developed a certain predilection for typical healthy Spanish food, unavoidably  combined with less fast food due to the usual dinners with friends. The main cause of that change was that I had to have breakfast, lunch and dinner in my college dorm\u00b4s dining room, which had amazingly good cooks.

At that point, I would let his talking go on without stopping him through interruption.

There is the possibility to set up your seat. It is your own decision when you get up, because there are no time limitations. There are no times when you have to be at the bus stop. If you use public transport for long distances in a city, you will often change buses. There is the risk that you will not get the connecting bus and, so, you are stressed.\nIn conclusion, travelling by car is the easiest and best way. I think that it is not possible to use public transport, because there are no buses or trains. Maybe car sharing is an innovative alternative to public transport. Many people use their car alone. Most of the time they have free seats in their cars.

This mode of transport is cheap and ecological. Also, more and more the cities are building a lot of bike lanes, so it is a good alternative.\nFor travelling to other cities or town, in my opinion, the car will remain the most used mode of transport, although new modes of transport could change this situation.\nFinally, I think that the most used mode of transport in the cities in the future will be the bus, metro and bike, and for travelling between cities, the car will remain the most used.", "I normally dream but don't remember when I wake up.

", "Digital advertising; an exciting but undesirable business\n\n\nIt is indisputable that advertising has become a permanent fixture in our daily lives. Once a curious novelty that was largely considered a harmless addition to our sometimes dull and overly familiar environment, it was welcomed as fun and informative. It was also - if one wished to do so - relatively easy to ignore.  But we have now entered a new era of the attention-grabbing business: its digitalisation. \nTheir transformation from innocent posters to digital screens ranging in size from minuscule to vast has made adverts all-pervasive. Researchers say that an average adult in the developed world is now exposed to hundreds of commercial messages every day.\n\nThose involved in this lucrative business are in awe of the almost endless possibilities that recent technological advances offer them. Multimedia, advertising and entertainment companies now work in synergy to target everyone from toddlers who can barely speak to pensioners confused by the speed of life in the new age, unsubtly playing on their needs and desires in order to turn them all into faithful consumers. \nThey have so successfully insinuated their own product into our everyday existence that we no longer see it anymore as what it really is: a nuisance. Creators of adverts have long given up on informing the consumers and instead opt for seducing them. The result is insincere, misleading and often deceitful messages that our minds are saturated with.\n\nPerhaps it is time to do an experiment and hit a pause button and reflect upon this subject.  Imagine a world without adverts, for a week at least. Would it be bleak and boring and leave us at a loss as to what to buy, or might it just turn out to be a long-yearned-for respite?\n", "Dear Paul,\nwe haven't seen each other for a while, so you don't know much about me lately.

I think going abroad is much more exciting.\n\nVisiting your own country certainly has its advantages. \nFirst of all, you don't have to take very long trips. Also, you can have the opportunity to discover new places just next to your home. Besides, this type of vacation is usually less expensive than going abroad. \n\nOn the other hand, many people prefer visiting other countries.\nActually, they like the idea of visiting an unknown land, where everything is different, from the weather to the habits. Furthermore, they also like going abroad to visit important and famous cities around the world, like Paris, Madrid, New York. \n\nIn my opinion, traveling to a foreign country makes people open their minds to other cultures. In fact, going abroad is a nice way to make new friends, try new things and improve a foreign language. In addition, if you plan your vacation at the last minute, you can also save money on planes or hotels. \n\nIn conclusion, I think it's important to know both our own countries and foreign lands.\n\n", "That\u2019s my dream\" when I joined  the faculty of languages and translation I was very happy because I had achieved my dream.

Fame is a choice of many people; it was their dream. But it doesn't mean they haven't got some rights to have private lives. Many of them have got family members who don't want to have anything in common with fame. Usually, journalists also follow them all the time. It's very important to remember if you're famous, you should protect your family. Sometimes it happens that journalists write some silly gossip about famous people which is not true. It may be a danger for the family of a celebrity, politician, famous person, and because of it some could break up. But on the other hand, being famous is a free choice for many people. They want to be rich and famous and they know that journalist will  follow them. But sometimes it doesn't depend on us. If you're a queen, a member of a royal family, from your birth you'll be observed by the press and magazines. It's a price of being famous.

Thus, some people claim that the social trend tends to reduce the popularity of travelling by public transport. As a result, this development is highly controversial in positive and negative ways.\n\n", "Introduction\nThe aim of this proposal is to present suggestions regarding the ways in which the extra funding could be used for the benefit of the students and, indirectly, for the benefit of the local community. Needless to say, in order to combat the rising tide of social problems in Hampshire, the Education Authority decided to increase funds for the educational sector.\nSports Club\nSporting activities might boost the students' overall condition and this is the reason why they are necessary. It is well known that physical activity contributes to improving physical and mental health.\nDrama Club\nThis kind of club will allow students to express their feelings in a non-violent manner, learn how to manage their reactions and develop creative talent. A drama club will make examining plays such as Shakespeare's more enjoyable than solely studying them will. \nCookery classes \nCookery classes are very important because students here are young adults that need to have basic skills such as cooking in order to manage themselves and live an independent life. Cooking classes will help students spend less money on eating out and they will start eating more healthily because by making their own food they will be more aware of what they are eating.\nDIY Classes\n\"Do it yourself\" classes improve practical skills. As most college students will soon leave for university and will live in dorms, without their parents, they are obliged to fix malfunctions by themselves. The information they acquire during these courses will help them for the rest of their lives. \nCitizenship classes\nAnother kind of classes that are necessary are citizenship classes as teenagers nowadays are deficient in this field. These courses will develop the civic sense of students and they will start getting involved actively in society.\nConclusion\nThe overall purpose of these actions is to keep young adults in school and to educate them. The Education Authority believes that social problems are linked with a decrease in participation in extra-curricular activities and it suggests that the college should use extra funding to solve this issue. Organising clubs and courses such as the ones mentioned above would ensure the improvement of the situation.", "I'm Emad from Egypt.

At first, I was not interested in it, since I didn't have any idea how to play, as I had only played basketball and volleyball. However, I didn't enjoy those two at all. Moreover, I also didn't like to do exercise which was tiring and my strength was extremely weak so that every time we did 800 kilometers, I always ranked in the last three. But when I decided to sit out and chatted with my friends, one of my male friends, who has still kept in touch to this day, asked me to play with him. After he understood the reason why I didn't have any desire to play, he told me to give it a try, and if I still didn't like it, he would't force me. Then, he taught me how to play. For example, when hitting, use the strength of the whole arm and don't just use your elbow, or you will feel tired quickly.\n  While playing, I rejoiced at this exercise, because I had never sweated so much and felt refreshed before. The funniest thing to me was that I thought I was a kid who was studying in kindergarten because of the way he taught. When hitting the ball back successfully, he would say ''good, keep going\" or \"you did it''. Hitting the ball again and again, I learned I loved badminton unconsciously, because it not only includes running, but also concentrating.\n  Badminton is an easy sport that everyone can try. Just focus on the ball and hit it back. In addition, before playing, you must warm up and relax your muscles after playing in case you suffer injuries.", " Learning many ideas and knowing detailed facts are both considered  crucial  for  students' education.  Some people think that knowing facts  is easier and more practical. Nevertheless, others consider learning  ideas and concepts to be the best way to  deal with many academic and real-life problems. l   completely  agree with the idea that it is important for  students to learn ideas and concepts  rather than learn facts. I would like to explain my reasons.\n \n        First, learning facts  can help students to solve one kind of problem that they may face. However, ideas and concepts give people a competitive edge when dealing with other similar issues. For example, I don\u2019t grasp an idea that my teacher has explained  in class, but just remember the facts.   When I do my homework, I find  the problem is different than in the case discussed in the class. But, if I go back to my textbook and  try to realize ideas and concepts, I work out the problem easily. From this experience, I learn that I should not just remember  facts, but should try my best to understand ideas and concept. Thus, I can  solve many kinds of problem  simply.\n\n   Second, learning ideas and concepts supports self-education significantly. Consequently, you can reach high academic levels. It is easy to find out facts from people around you. However, learning ideas and concepts needs more investigation and understanding from many of the academic textbooks.  Nowadays, there is limited time for any teacher to cover all points on  a certain subject. When students  grasp  the idea of any topic it will be easy to understand all issues related to it deeply. For instance,  when I  was in senior year in high school, I took physics class. There were masses of materials on a specific issue, but I tried my best to grasp <unk> and that made me recognize any unmentioned points.\n\nIn summary, absorbing ideas and facts is the most effective strategy. Not only do students learn more in  their studies, but also it helps students  understand many facts in our lives better than any other way.       \n", "This review is to tell you about the Astoux restaurant, which is situated in the heart of Cannes by the seashore. \n\n\nAs you enter the place you are welcomed by a very natural setting.

Therefore, we can feel the enormous role of music in our lives. \nTo my mind, the beauty of music does not depend on its varieties. People enjoy it and do not think about its genre. For example, there are various music competitions<unk> Eurovision Song Contest which are organized in many countries. People from almost all over the world attend to participate in it. \nBeing at the core of the culture of a country, it influences  national reputation.

He looked down and noticed that there was a city of marine life and the battle wasn't really a battle, it was a revolution, where the fish were the citizens. This meant some  fish were damaged thanks to the revolution, which also meant that, while they were reproducing, the genes of the baby were changed. And the new fish will not be the same conventional fish, they will taste different or simply change  shape. If there were a revolution in the city, obviously the fish would try to escape. The fish were going to the beach where the people fished. That was his entire dream. He was now scared to find out if that was real or not. But it was too illogical to be true; the good thing was that he wasn't the one that would go and fish, which would be the leader.

After I joined ACU (Australian Catholic University), I  found vast differences in teaching methods between Nepal and Australia.  In Nepal, students study individually and do not ask questions of the tutor even if they are confused.  Meanwhile, Australian education is based on making students learn new skills.  Students need to take  active participation in discussion with their peers.  Besides, students are able to raise questions with the lecturer because they can express their opinion.

Peer learning is a small group of three to five students who are kept together to discuss the content and carry out educational activities in mutual engagement.  (Fisher, as cited in Strake, 2010, p.2), Peer learning is a two-way learning process in which members of a group find it easier to discuss the content.  It helps to know the importance of group work by giving and receiving feedback on particular tasks.   According to Hamp (2002), the goal of an EAP (English For Academic Purpose) course is to teach students relevant study skills they need throughout their degree.  It helps to share  ideas and knowledge, among  students and make them think critically, by using formal language while writing, and so on. \nIn conclusion, the adoption of the Australian academic culture has developed strategies for my learning. I have become an independent learner and started to raise  questions and share my opinion with the tutor.

I totally agree with this statement and, to my mind, people should travel a lot, because our world is incredible.

You can drive wherever and whenever you want. Even just in cities, let alone travelling long distances. But, on the other hand, a traffic jam or bad weather can make our trip inconvenient. Moreover, there are not many parking places in big cities.\nSecondly, travelling by public transport is much cheaper. Not everyone can afford to travel by car every day, so they choose public transport. \nThirdly, we should take care of our environment! Cars pollute our air, which leads to many diseases such as asthma, allergies and even cancer. Moreover, cars release poisonous exhaust fumes and chemicals into the air, which mix with the water in the clouds, and the polluted rain, which later falls, damages trees, lakes and buildings.\nSo, my advice is to travel by bicycle (or at least, use public transport), because it is environmentally friendly!", "Next Monday, I am going to India.

So who can be bothered to take public transportation anymore?  \n\nThird, public transportation sucks, when you think about it. You can picture the crowded subways, dirty buses, and the difficulty/hassles of the public transportation transfers in your mind.

It seems more convenient to them to get around on their own rather than be tied to public transport.\nIt can be argued that public transport systems have been losing their popularity in many ways. People feel that they can get to their destinations on time if they drive their own car. It is true in many cases, as public modes of transport like buses, trains and trams, have their own specific routes and stops. This may cause people to get to their particular destination late. Secondly, public transport seems to be getting more expensive day by day, which has reduced its popularity. People therefore find cars more affordable for them.\nIn modern society, cars have become cheaper to buy, which in turn has helped people to have them. Moreover, many car finance companies have made it easy for every individual to purchase a car.\nIn conclusion, I would say that, due to recent progress in society, there has been a considerable increase in car ownership. It can therefore easily be predicted that there will be no role for public transport in the future.", "My idol was, is, and always will be Justin Bieber. I remember the first time that I saw his videos. I didn't write his last name correctly and I couldn't find him on YouTube. It started when I was 12 or 13 years old, his music meant everything to me. He was always talking about following your dreams and never giving up. In 2014, I met a couple from One Direction called Larry Stylinson  but they couldn't \"come out\" because of their managers. I admire them because no matter what their managers make them go through, they always find a way to show us how much they love each other and how much they want to be free. I really hope in this \"hiatus\", this is what they called their break, they can be happy and spend time together without fake girlfriends, managers or the media around them. I want them to be happy.

I think I have watched almost all the football matches in history, especially when it was the FIFA World Cup season. I would not sleep until the game was over. Although I don't play really well, I would choose it over any other sport, any day. I enjoy playing football because the feeling you get when you are on the field is priceless. I feel free when I'm on the pitch. I was told that I was a natural player when I was young. I didn't need any coaching since my football skills came naturally. I think that I got this from my dad and my elder brother. Both of them are just like me, we <unk> when it comes to football! 90% of our conversation involves football and we can talk all day about it for sure. Here is some advice for anyone who is starting this sport. Make sure you play <unk> for the first time and make sure you wear football boots when you're playing on the pitch. This advice is to avoid you injuring yourself as a beginner at football. ", "I completely disagree with the statement \"there is no future for public transport\". I do believe that with time people become more conscious of the idea of cities being convenient for everyone. Although a private car is more convenient for its owner than public transport, it is not in use the majority of the time and that means wasting city space on parking while it could be used as a public space. At the same time, it is not impossible to solve the task of comfort and efficacy simultaneously. For instance, a network of taxi cabs with affordable prices could combine the comfort of a personal car and the work-load of public transportation. Nowadays, all the car manufacturers have accepted the task of designing a robot-driven car that in future would resolve the issues of safety and availability of taxis 24 hours 7 days a week. But how is it possible to persuade citizens to make the right choice? Unfortunately, the main method is to make private cars, if not a luxury, then to make their usage economically less efficient compared to public transportation. And the underground, and light tram system are still more ecological and faster.", "Some people like shopping. Some people love shopping, and some people cannot live without shopping.

Nevertheless, being famous has both its benefits and drawbacks. \nFirst of all, celebrities are usually wealthy, so they have an easier life than other people. Luxurious homes, cars, expensive clothes and other pleasures of life are then available when people become famous. Moreover, they travel all around the world and spend their holidays in expensive resorts, get the best hotel rooms and the most efficient service. \nOn the other hand, lack of privacy is a major disadvantage in a famous person's life, as their personal life's boundaries are constantly crossed by paparazzi and journalists. Besides, the more they succeed, the more their fans expect  them to achieve.

In my opinion, sometimes stars' behaviour is very surprising. To illustrate my point of view I want to give some examples. On the one hand, famous people want to protect their private life, but on the other hand they want to be followed by paparazzi. First of all, being on the covers of newspapers and magazines helps them  make themselves more attractive to directors. The other reason is that actors want to be recognisable, because popularity gives the possibility to earn more money.

In contrast, people who take public transport can enjoy the journey more because they don't waste energy on driving.

Although they are not new clothes, they are usually trendy and of high quality. If the idea of a street market does not seduce you, I recommend you visit  a little shop in Saint Peter street, The Old Bag, where you can buy bags and other accessories, such as umbrellas, gloves and scarfs. In addition, the shop is very cheap and you can have a cup of coffee inside while you are shopping. \n\n\nRecommendations\n\nIf you are a fashion lover you should visit Linda and Nany's. I recommend  having a look inside, just in case. By contrast, if you are more keen to save money, the best option is the street market. I suggest a quick visit to every shop and making comparisons of price and quality.\n", "Roger O'keefe, 83 years old, is being referred to your care for further assistance.

Public transport includes buses, trains, and subway, but cars, bicycles, taxis are not forgotten. At the moment of choosing, very different aspects, like ecological effects, economic viability and even <unk>, take part in the decision.\n\nFirstly, the car option is the best one in terms of comfort, because you do not depend on a specific time to travel and modern cars have the best technology in equipment and facilities. Then public transport is not as comfortable as the former, because if you're lucky, you can find a place to sit and forget it if it is in the rush hour. \n\nOn the other hand, traffic is the biggest problem when talking about transport, the car's conveniences are replaced by the need for punctuality and, depending on the city,  delays are a concerning point when we talk about travelling by bus or train. However, the economic aspect is very important to consider when we talk about convenience. Cars are the most expensive mode of transport. Not only because of oil prices, but also the costs of insurance, the car, the parking fees, etc. In comparison with a bus ticket that costs four pesos and you are sure that sooner or later it will come. \n\nTo sum up, neither cars nor public transport are considered the perfect option, but considering the long term consequences, as is common nowadays in some European countries, bicycles are the best way. Riding a bicycle reduces traffic, costs, ecological impact, and even car crashes.

One way is to put advertising on the internet and use social networks. On the other hand, we could set up stands in shopping malls. In order to obtain maximum benefit from this, it will be helpful if we give away product samples.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the advertising campaign must be appropriate to the target market. I therefore feel justified in recommending that the campaign in shopping malls would be more effective for us. This is mainly because, besides it being cheaper, customers will become familiar with the product.\n\nIn conclusion, we have different options for this campaign.

I am  very interested in the job, because I would like to work for you this summer. I could start whenever you like.\n\nI  worked as an assistant chef in a Lagunak Restaurant last summer. I worked in another restaurant in London, but I would like to look after children, because I have studied to be a teacher.\nAlso, I have worked in other summer camps, which are Funny Camp, Nature Camp, etc.\nMy CV is enclosed.\n\nI believe I am suitable for this job, because I enjoy working with children and I know how to cook very well.\nAlso, for me, the salary is not a problem, because my motivation is to learn.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\nYours faithfully.\nJuan Antonio", "There are many fields of study that have not been discovered or researched by humans. There are many reasons why research is hardly conducted. As a result, there is a debate about whether educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing a field of study in which they are unlikely to succeed. <unk>I agree with the statement, with qualifications, for the following reasons.\n\tAdmittedly, some of the research needs  investment in many resources that educational institutions cannot afford. Such research will indeed fail. Educational institutions should dissuade students.\n\tHowever, if there is not a lack of  resources for the field of study, educational institutions should support students in their field of study. Education\u2019s greatest purpose is to encourage students to try and to learn from  failure. Take Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, for example. He tried a lot of different materials to make a filament for the light bulb. Once, people thought he would not succeed.\n\tEven though the research cannot really succeed, students can learn some things from the process of the research. In the course of the research, students will think about how to develop the process of the research and know which segment will cause the problem that makes the research fail. In addition, students, in the course of research, may create serendipity. Like Alexander Flrming Alexander, the inventor of  antibiotics, discovered  Penicillin accidentally from  research into the germ.\n\t\u201cYou must do the thing you think you cannot do\u201d, said  Eleanor Roosevelt. The invaluable thing is to turn the impossibility into a possibility. Therefore, educational institutions should encourage  students attempting  research which is unlikely to succeed.\n", "We human beings are highly socialized creatures in the world. Therefore, it is inevitable that we have to learn to be part of  society. Parents, in some cases, are mentors to children. However, considering the complexity of  society, I believe it is better to learn in schools rather than from parents.\n\nFirst of all, there is no denying that parents may teach their children enormous fundamental life skills on which their progeny count. Nevertheless, the skills are not diverse enough for children to deal with specific problems when living in a complex society. For example, one of my senior high school classmates  encountered a communication problem  in  his family. As a consequence, they have never talked to each other since then.\n\nFollowing the previous paragraph, there will always be people with different lifestyles, attitudes, and beliefs in every aspect of one's life. If we have not lived and learned the skills in a group, especially in school, we will not be skilled before entering  society. \n\nSociety as a whole is a place where both competition and cooperation take turns to continuously influence every member. If we only live in our original family, parents will probably forgive us when we make mistakes. In contrast, living in a society is another story: people might blame, compete, or even hurt others, no matter who you are. Learning in schools, however, provides a valuable opportunity for children to learn not only from teachers, but also from relationships between peers, and as a result, paves the way for being independent in the future. \n\nIn a nutshell, there is a great deal of knowledge that needs to be acquired by children in order to live in  society. School, a place with diverse students along with diverse attitudes towards life, might be better than merely learning with  parents.", "It is well known that an image is better than a thousand words, and that may be the reason for the success of television in a recent survey as the most important invention of the last 100 years.\nHowever, this choice may not be the wisest, as there are other inventions more useful than television and with better future applications.\nI am referring to the Internet. Born in the 1970's as a military project to interconnect  missile facilities and the central headquarters, it soon spread to universities and educational centers. This fact, along with the spread of personal computers, quickly led to a generalization of its use in the first decade of the XXI century.\nNobody wants to dismiss the importance of television and its achievements. For more than 50 years, it has been the main entertainment channel, displacing others like radio, theater, cinema and, sadly, also books.\nIn its first years, television was also an important channel for culture (theater plays, classic films, etc.). Unfortunately, in recent years, television has lost this educational focus.\nThe Internet, on the other hand, has become more and more popular, not only for entertainment, but also for business, and today it is almost impossible to find an activity in which the Internet doesn't play a major role.\nThe Internet has also replaced television for watching films and TV shows, especially among young people, who prefer to download and watch  videos instead of watching to the fixed schedule of TV.", " Nowadays, it's believed that it's better to work on your own than to work as a group. At first, I completely agreed with this, but then when I started to think about it I realized that it's not like that. \n\n Firstly, I think that if you work as a team,  you can help each other and if you have more people to talk about any situation with you can have a better and more complete answer, because you have the ideas and the knowledge of every single member of the group.\n \nSecondly, I think that the members of the team give you support, love and companionship. Sometimes the members of a group begin to be so close to you that you love them the same as if they were part of your family. Moreover, if it is a really nice group, it is more fun to work with them than to work alone.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that it's better to work as a team than to work on your own because the team give you love, companionship and you can have a very good time.", "My favorite sport is football. It's the most popular sport in the world. I enjoy it because it's well known and easy to find partners to play with. Watching football is also a wonderful experience. My favorite international league is the English premier league. My advice to anyone who is starting this sport is to start it early and play it regularly not to lose fitness. Also, joining a team would be a great idea.", "I live in Bhubaneswar with my family. About fifty thousand people live in the city. It is a clean and environmentally friendly city. The city has its own public transportation system and waste management system. People who live here take care of the city's environment, so the city is a clean and green place. The city contains about thirty public parks. The parks are full of greenery; these parks are also used as playgrounds for children. Trees in the parks are not sufficient according to the requirements of our city. Ten year ago, the local governing body of the city decided to plant more trees and it asked advice from the citizens of the city about the proposal. Everybody got interested in the project. We planted trees near the side of highways, unused land, and outside of the city. Now these trees are grown up. It give shade, shelter to animals, and purifies the air. The trees also stop soil erosion in the rainy season.\nOur city has a well equipped waste management system. Each house in the city has two types of dustbin to keep recyclable and non-recyclable items separate. In the morning, a waste collection truck comes and it takes this waste away. These waste materials are processed in an environmentally friendly way. ", "A couple of years ago, I could hardly see any bins in supermarkets and houses. Nowadays, I see bins everywhere and even a small child of 3 being taught to put unwanted materials in the bin. It is truly an amazing experience and  how much progress my small village has made in 2 years. However, separate bins for different categories of rubbish are not provided. So, we can easily see people throwing everything in the same bin. In spite of throwing rubbish in a bin, we also do some harm to the environment unknowingly, because there are different kinds of materials, rubbish, some are recyclable and some are not.

Also, if you want to travel, you have to make money for that and then travel. Furthermore, you don't study during this period and when you want to start university, you won't be able to remember some important things\nSo, if you take a year off, you have to think about it.", "The vacation is what we have waited for for three long months of hard study, homework, tests and more. Even though we have finished the term exams, they  only gave us a week free. I did not do everything I wanted because I was forced by my parents to go to Boquete.\nThe day we finished our last exam, I was not sure what to do. First a friend was not talking to me, because someone told her a lie, so we went to yogen fruz to talk, then I went to the gym and walked to Gabo's house and then Dani's.

The room's number was 666. He knew that she was inside, waiting for the last conversation about  the life of Rose. He pushed the door and went in. She was sitting on the chair. When she saw him, she smiled. Then she started talking: \"Welcome, pretty boy, I have been waiting for you. Please sit down\". He took a chair, staring at her with rage. \"As you well know, Rose's life is in your hands\" she said, and kept talking: \"...You are the only one that can save her life, but before , thatyou must keep your promise\". \"I know \", he replied with a sad tone.

", "In this set of materials, the listening passage discusses the advantages of alcohol and how it contributes to improving health and personality, and the reading contradicts this by revealing the downside of it.\n\nIn the listening passage, the professor discusses the advantages of alcohol and how it helps to reduce heart attacks and strokes by 40 percent, due to the fact that it reduces blood clots and slows down the deterioration of brain function. In addition, moderate drinking helps to maintain healthy <unk>, because some research has shown that people who drink moderately have a lesser proportion of body fat, because alcohol speeds up the metabolism, which makes calories burn quickly. Moreover, it is stated that people who drink moderately have positive social behavior, which means that they are more likely to establish contact than non-drinkers, and they are more social, popular and they are more likely to be married.\n\nOn the other hand, the reading contrasts with this by mentioning the disadvantages of alcohol. Firstly, it is stated that alcohol leads to weight gain, because it has more calories per gram than any other drink, and it is mentioned in the passage that you need to walk a mile to lose the calories of a glass of wine. Furthermore, studies have shown that alcohol stimulates the appetite, which makes people consume more than they need. For example, researchers have found that belly fat is related to alcohol. Second, alcohol can cause some serious health issues, especially cirrhosis of the liver, heart failure, brain damage and a variety of cancers. Third, people who drink alcohol tend towards aggression and violence. In fact, studies show that 86 percent of all homicides and 60 percent of sexual assaults are linked to alcohol.\n", "\nIn many countries, it's considered that relatives are the close family and the only people with whom an individual can be just the way he is.\n This point of view is based on, for example, the fact that you share an important bond with your family or that you know everything about some members, like your cousins and they know everything about you. Maybe most of us have spent our childhood with our cousins and they were our best friends for ages. Siblings are another strong point to support this statement. It's usual to hear that this kind of bond is the strongest inside a family, because everybody thinks that siblings are the only ones whom you can rely on, despite the fact that it's not always true. I should talk in the third person, because I don't have any brothers or sisters, but I do have close cousins. In my case, this role is played by them.\n\nOn the other hand, we can find arguments against this statement. For example, the debate about the statement that you cannot choose your family, but you can choose your friends. Thus, it fits perfectly for those people who have a bad relationship with their families. They have to look for the needs provided by the family in other people whom they can trust. \n\nIn conclusion, from my point of view, it's true that it is less probable to find negative feelings inside the family, like envy, <unk> or hate. So, if you tell a secret to your sister or your cousin, it's almost obvious that they aren't going to spread it. Even if you look for good advice, some members of your family could help you from the heart. But, family does not always guarantee these functions, and neither do friends. However, friends can be like a family and fulfil all these functions, too. Therefore, I would just like to remark that family does not mean relatives, but those people with whom you can feel at home. That is, in any place, suddenly you could find someone who could become your closest relative. ", " Owning a pet is popular today even if your home is in a big city. Many people today have pets of all kinds.\n  Owning a pet would benefit all members of a family. First of all, a pet is a friend for the family and, much better, is a member of the family. One more advantage of owning a pet is that it helps children learn to be responsible and caring. It is also good to adopt an animal which  doesn't have a home and food and give it this love and affection.\n  On the other hand, there are a lot of disadvantages to owning a pet in big cities. Pets and animals in general need fresh air and exercise outside and not to be always in an apartment. I have heard about pets that  get sick through living in a small apartment in  town, and that is terrible.\n  In my opinion, it might seem good to have a pet if we  take care of it. All in all, owning a pet in a big city must be done carefully, ensuring all that the pet needs.", "The phenomenon of homeless people has become a serious problem and many countries cannot solve this problem. The number of homeless people is increasing not just in the developing countries but all over the world. In my opinion, homeless people are victims because nobody wants to live without shelter.\n\n        First of all, being without a home is a horrible problem. One of the major reasons for this problem is wars, especially in the Arab countries like Syria, Libya and Yemen. Every day on the news we see refugees who are living in miserable conditions. They live in tents that do not protect them from cold weather or dangerous insects. They do not have enough food. In addition, financial crises. Most companies have financial problems, so the ideal solution to them is downsizing. After a while, the people who are laid off will not have enough money to live and they will become homeless people. Furthermore, street children  are a result of family troubles. Cases of divorce are increasing and many children run away and prefer to live in the streets instead of in a home full of problems.  \n\n      <unk> the idea above, some people believe that homeless people are criminals and they cause danger to our society because they need money and food so they might steal or kill for this.\n\n    To conclude, the world has a complicated problem, so governments and charitable organizations must take a quick decision and put in place a real solution to solve this problem. Homeless people are human beings and they must have their rights in life.\n\n", "Dear Paul, \n\nLast month, as you may know, I was a volunteer on the occasion of my favourite band's concert in Katowice.

This results in different  views on whether people agree that the best things for improving people's lives have already taken place. I hold the belief that the topic is completely wrong for me, even if some improvements are easy to use and solve  most  problems.\n\nFirst, the growth of the population still continues, the space for living is still a serious problem, although the skyscraper has already solved  most  problems related to the population crisis. On the other hand, the skyscraper causes more problems, such as pollution. For example, I designed the high-rise architecture in a highly populated city in Taiwan. The skyscraper provides more space for excess population. However, the building will produce more pollution if the skyscrapersare constructed from modern materials, such as steel and concrete. They will destroy the environment when <unk>. The pollution will harm the local people and the environment <unk>. This is why I mentioned that the problem still exists and the problem only moves to other regions and types.\n\nSecond,  computer systems look like they solve  most  problems. However, these systems are more dangerous in specific situations. A \"BUG\" may  appear from a man-made system because of  incomplete coding.

They will use that information to steal people\u2019s money over the phone and we will trust them because they have the correct personal information. This is a normal phenomenon in Taiwan. However, the police can\u2019t do anything because of the hacker's anonymity. That is why I said that the best improvements  still do not exist, even though  computer systems have already solved some problems.\n\nOf course, some people may be moved to disagree with my position on this issue. That being said, I still feel the reasons I have presented are strong ones, such as architecture and computer systems.\n", "I felt a deep sense of self-hatred and guilt! How could I cut the rope?

First of all, my altruistic nature is due to my biological desire to help others. For instance, one day I was walking in the park when I saw a girl falling down from a children's swing in the playing area. I helped her immediately, and after I was sure  that she was fine, I called her mother and told her about this incident. She thanked me a lot. I thought she was my responsibility, but it can't be the same every time. In addition, young people display  altruistic behavior from the 18th month. For example, last week I was stressed out, so I lost my phone at the university. I did not realize that until I returned home. While I was on my way to the university, my little sister prayed for me to find  my phone. So, in my opinion, children when they are witnesses always want to help strangers.

Some people believe, however, that community service orders are more appropriate in some cases. When do you think that it is right to order people to work in the community to pay for their crimes?\u201d\nIn recent years, the most common punishment for criminals has been prison. There are certain people who believe community service orders are more adequate in some cases. People who break the law, should be ordered to work in the community in order to pay for their misdeeds, when they have done a minor offence or if they have acted unintentionally.\nCommunity service orders are more appropriate than prison punishments when people have acted unintentionally. Sending criminals to prison is a serious verdict for people that have made a mistake. Nobody is sinless and people should not be treated as seriously as being sent to jail. For example, graffiti makers in Bulgaria are sent to prison for 4 years. This is unfair, because they do not do any harm to the environment nor to society. It is better that they do a certain amount of community work, for example clean off their graffiti, which will teach them how hard it is to clean off graffiti, and thus, prevent them from making new graffiti.\nWorking in the community is more appropriate compared to sending people to prison when criminals have committed a minor offence. Limiting people\u2019s freedom because of minor, non-harmful to the society crimes is inhumane. Everybody deserves freedom, despite their crimes. Although their misdeeds should not be tolerated, I believe that they had better do some community work. This will help them understand their mistakes and prevent them in future. For example, in Bulgaria, people who lie down and relax on the grass in the park are sent to jail for 6 years, because they are considered to be \u201cdoing serious damage to the environment and preventing the park from further development\u201d.\nCommunity service orders should be used when people have acted unintentionally and when they have committed a minor offence, as this will help them realize their mistakes, without them being limited in freedom by being sent to prison. This will help them realize their mistakes and thus, quit making them.\n", "Michael was a little boy. He was 10 years old. He went with his parents to his grandfather's home.

Although Michael was bigger, Sarah could control him. Every day they went to the sea to play and swim until the sun set. Once a day Sarah made a challenge to Michael about who could enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out of the other hole on the shore, but Michael was afraid. He was asking himself which animals could be there or if there was air there, but he had no choice, so he accepted the challenge. Sarah told him she would go first. She took a breath... a deep one, and started to dive. Micheal was afraid. He waited for Sara to get out. He went to the shore to see if she came from the other side, but he found no footprints.

The number of people using public transport far outstrips the number of people the transport system was designed to handle. The trains and buses are crowded, and newer routes do not reflect the changing demand.\n\nMass production has made cars more affordable for the middle class in recent years.

I really enjoyed reading your blog about shadowing students. I like the way you gave examples of how you felt and how you would change your own lessons. \nI live in the Netherlands and at our school it\u2019s the same. Our pupils have to sit for many hours a day, and they find it hard to sit still and to be silent. I also think that a lesson went well if they didn\u2019t talk and did their work. However, when I was reading your article I felt ashamed due to the fact that when every teacher teaches the way I do it is logical that our students can\u2019t be quiet and can\u2019t sit without making a movement. Moreover, when we as teachers have a study day, I get tired myself from sitting all day.\nYour key takeaway #3 was shocking for me, the feeling of being a nuisance is dreadful. In my opinion, I am very patient and willing to explain difficult topics over and over again. I really hope my students feel the same, otherwise I have to change my attitude! I get paid for being a teacher and, as I see it, it is my job to clarify things and help my pupils to understand. \nYour experience gave me food for thought especially when you wrote that our pupils are sitting passively and listening for approximately 90 per cent of their classes. I am going to look at my lessons again to see if I can change those lessons and try to make my pupils active. I teach at Basisberoeps level and I have already started to use some activities where they must use an Ipad and make pictures or short films. For example, my pupils had to learn the difference between this and that and I let them make a short film about pointing at things in school saying: this door, that window, this is my teacher, that is a chair.                                                                            \nHowever, I find it difficult to use activities every lesson because they are time-consuming. Although the main reason that prevents me from using them is my colleagues. I don\u2019t see them doing activities, it looks as if they are just doing their lessons and want to use a book and that is it. For instance, when I hear that another English teacher finished Unit 5 and I am still at Unit 4, I feel incompetent. It gives me the feeling that the most important part of teaching is doing all the exercises in the book and getting all the work done.

Actually, I think I would really enjoy it and my day would end  with a tired smile, but a very bright smile. I've never had any experience of this kind before, but I have a brother three years younger than me and a little cousin who's seven years old with whom I usually  play a lot when I don't have to study. And, since it's a summer camp and I don't have homework to do, I would put all of myself into this job.

Kids around these ages (2 to 5 years old) do not have a mature critical sense and anything can easily persuade them. For instance, when I was three years old, I used to be captivated by all the toys which were presented in TV commercials just because of the way they were presented. One of them was \"the ultimate max steel\", which was about a hundred dollars.\n     Secondly, I am also opposed to the <unk> of this advertising because of the severe consequences it has on the parents' and child's relationships. It is common to see parents having issues with their kids because of this kind of commercial. Many parents have an unhealthy relationship, or even a wrecked relationship, with their kids. One example is what happened to my cousin Patricia when she had her first child, called Sophia. One day, Sophia got really excited about an advertisement for a barbie doll and she could not think about anything else than having this toy. Unfortunately, my cousin did not have enough money to buy it, but her daughter - a three-year-old kid - did not understand it and got angry with Patricia, not speaking to her for three weeks!\n    In conclusion, I am strongly in favour of this statement. Advertisements for young kids, not only upto 5 but upto 8 years old should be forbidden because of the kid's vulnerability and the risk to their parents' relationships with them.  Finally, if the advertisements are still broadcast, it is essential some educational politics comes with them, valorizing and teaching kids about understanding their parents.", "If you have a car, you  probably think that travelling by car is better than by bus, but there are a lot of people who don't have a car, so they are used to going by bus and, for them, this way of travelling has become more convenient, because they have done it since they were children.

This fact leads the teachers to be unsure of what they are doing. Besides, there are no results that can be analysed or checked.\nSecondly, there are two sorts of schools in Spain - public and private -, which leads to a big difference in the educational knowledge. While public ones must obey governmental laws strictly, private schools have some privileges.\nKnowing this about the Spanish education system, we can now talk about technology. I obviously agree that technology is necessary nowadays. So, schools and educational institutions in general have to update the way they teach. Technology does not imply a new instrument being taught but a new tool and source of knowledge (if used correctly). In fact, using technology without changing the content would be a total failure. \nTeachers must learn how to use these new technological devices in order to get their students motivated. Moreover, they should include the past information and the new information. Thus, this would help students know how the world has evolved and how it will be. In other words, technology should be used as a tool for students to be aware of the development of society and its advantages and disadvantages.\nThese new technologies also help in the development of teaching. We can make dynamic classes by being in contact with other schools. In the case of subjects such as English and French, students would improve their skills by being in contact with students from different countries. Also, teachers could replace their methodologies following the best ones and the ones which contribute to having qualified students trained to face everyday life situations.\nIn conclusion, as a great teacher said, we have 21st century students learning with 20th century tools 19th century knowledge. Thus, there shouldn't be a technological revolution but an educational one. ", "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am writing in connection with the advertisement for a job in the USA SUMMER CAMPS.

The garbage control service is one of the main supporting subsidiaries of the urban council, which was founded two years ago. Five years ago, the town didn't have any garbage control services to manage the domestic rubbish. With this garbage control system, household waste is collected on a weekly basis and transported to recycling centers. The recycling centers sort this garbage and it is put into different categories to be recycled. Categorized garbage is then transported to the recycling process in the nearest factory.    \n\nTwo years ago, the council started a wastebasket distribution program among the villages, with the intention of easing the garbage collection process. With this approach, it is very convenient for the workers who are employed in the garbage control service, because they can collect all the garbage of a village from one place. Meanwhile, the urban council strongly discourage the use of plastic products and other artificial materials for the sake of our own cleanliness.

First, it is unnecessary to spend more money on school buses, because ,by Grade 5, children are able to take care of themselves and each other. They can communicate well and are aware of dangerous situations. For example, if they see drunk or dirty people on public buses, they could avoid sitting near them or report them to the bus driver. Second, it is a good opportunity to educate them in life skills such as knowing not to sit in priority seats or leave litter on the bus. \n\nIn contrast, I think that the parents who insist their children should only travel on school buses protect them too much. In daily life, many youngsters need to go to school and back by public transportation. In other words, if parents spoil their offspring, then they may become too dependent and incapable of functioning well in society later on.\n\nIn conclusion, it is not only a good chance to take the children on an adventure, but also help them become independent young adults. I think this way can help them with adapting to society early.", "My favourite sport is swimming. I like it because it makes me feel free, independent and happy. It is an individual sport but also a team activity. In my opinion, it is one of the healthiest sports there are because you can train not only your body but you can also develop your breathing. I do not swim in competitions, but almost since I was 3 years old, I always had great coaches who trained me according to my ability so that I never went over my limit. I have always felt comfortable as a child with my tank mates. During these years I have changed pools three times. At the moment, I am training at the Turin Sisport near Mirafiori. It is quite a tiring sport, but you can relax when the coach says it's time to take a break. If I had to give advice to someone who wants to start this sport, I would tell him not to worry if he doesn't feel confident. If he is afraid of the water, it is not recommended to do this sport, or being able to overcome his fear would be a great goal. All in all, I would recommend  anyone to do this sport. It is a sport that purifies and regenerates you.", "Friendship today\nFriendship is actually a really important issue nowadays. There are plenty of ways to make new friends. Facebook, Twitter\u2026 all of these social networks offer us the easiest way to make new friends.

Talking is truly the only way to get to know people and establish strong bonds.\nIn addition, some people try to find friends who always agree with them. However, it could be a little bit unhealthy. To be frank, a best friend has to offer you a different point of view and, what is more, it is important to say no sometimes.\nFor all of these reasons, we have to take care of our friendships these days and social networks are OK for being in touch with your friends.

Generally, it seems a modest sport or simple hobby, but it permits me to meet more and more people along the urban streets who do jogging too. Then you realise that running is a way of life, a healthy way of life. So, I enjoy running alone or with friends, because this sport has a lot of possibilities, more than I thought when I started to run after finishing High School. At the beginning, I had a flatmate who loved cycling and running, even in a city like Madrid. Therefore, we went out at night after university classes and we preferred soft soil paths to pavement. Later, I  had more roommates, colleagues and partners even who did this sport, which is among the most fashionable ones at the moment. Moreover, the races are <unk> and <unk> and more and more popular.

It influenced the further development of post-Soviet countries as well the as geopolitical situation in the whole world. It has also influenced  international relations not just within thepost-Soviet area, but also in the entire world, as the period after the collapse of the USSR was marked by a crash of bipolar structure in international relations. Since for fifty years the world lived under the shadow of the Cold War, fearing a fatal confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union, the dissolution of the USSR had a huge resonance not only in the US mass-media but also in  American society.\nThe American press had widely covered the revolution in the Baltic States and the tension which had been spread across the Soviet Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall, as well as the fall of communist governments within the whole former Soviet Bloc.\nThe tensions in the Soviet Union came to their peak in August 1991. While Gorbachev was on vacation in the Crimea, a group of right wing military and KGB leaders staged a coup in Moscow. The \"New York Times\u201d made a series of publications dedicated to the coup. They were published under the common title \u201cSoviet crisis\u201d. The articles headlined \u201cSoviet crisis\u201d  broadly described the situation in the capital of Russia. On  August 20, the \u201cNew York Times\u201d published an article which contained the excerpts from the news conference held by Acting President Gennadiy Yanayev and four other members of the State Committee for the State of Emergency.\nThe American press, summing up the era of Gorbachov, frequently highlighted his attempts to increase the openness of  Soviet society. Those attempts were considered as one of Gorbachov\u2019s main merits. \u201cThe buried secrets of past regimes and the foibles of the present one were exposed to public scrutiny by the press\" \u2013 the New York Times wrote. \nThe plotters  immediately encountered strong opposition from the leadership of the RSFSR leaders under the guidance of President Boris Yeltsin.

The main reason is the convenience of travelling by car in comparison with using public transport. Apart from that, there are many other benefits to buying a car instead of using buses or the underground every day.\n\nFirst of all, a car gives such a valuable thing as privacy. For example, driving a car, we can wear whatever we want and listen to the music at any volume. If the car is large enough, it can even be a perfect place for sleep. Additionally, if we are eager to travel outside the town in order to have some rest from a hectic rhythm of life, it will be more comfortable for us to use our cars. Only our own vehicle can provide us with an opportunity to find a quiet and pleasant place outside the city. Public transport can take us only to certain locations. Thus, it is clear that private transport such as cars has plenty of advantages.\n\nOn the other hand, we can encounter different problems while travelling by car. For instance, sitting in traffic jams always steals a lot of our precious time. Car accidents are the typical reason for this phenomenon. It means that travelling by car can even be more dangerous than using public transport. Generally, bus drivers are much more experienced than car drivers. Therefore, accidents caused by public transport happen quite rarely. This makes travelling by public transport much safer. Thus, I would argue that driving a car requires a lot of attention and understanding that careless behaviour on the road can do serious harm to other people.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that public transport will eventually lose its dominance due to the fact that all people want to be independent and travel on their own. ", "In this essay I would like to highlight how a wide range  of public transport  can help people to save a bit of money and a lot of stressful hours stuck in traffic jams. \n\nFirst, as everybody knows, the cost of fuel is increasing more and more. Adding to that the bills that owning a car will bring, it becomes immediately clear that it is cheaper to get around by public transport. Why then are there still so many people who prefer to drive their own car instead of sitting comfortably on the train or on the tube reading their favorite book on their way to work? I would say that this is because the public transport is not so efficient as it should be. \n\nIn my town, for example, I have waited for up to forty minutes before I could get a bus. I strongly believe that it is a shame because a lot of people like me would leave their vehicles at home and take a train instead.\n\nSecondly, the environment would improve. As far as I can see, the pollution caused by traffic is ruining monuments and making the air dirty and heavy, the same is true as far as waste of time is concerned. Obviously, the fewer cars there are around, the quicker you can get where you want to go.\n\nIn conclusion, I would really like politicians who care about public transport to improve the services so that more people could leave their vehicles at home and get around much more easily.", "There is no future for public transport, because travelling by car is so much more convenient.\n\nI do not agree with this statement because in big cities there are a lot of cars. If all the  people in a city use their own car at the same time, there will be a huge traffic jam, so travelling by car isn't much more convenient in this situation. There are more problems in big cities. One of them is parking. There are a lot of areas in a city where it is very difficult to park and you only have 2 options; you can park in a private car park and pay a lot of money or you can waste your time searching  for a parking space.", "Humans prefer a luxurious life. Public transport is a bit uncomfortable. With the coming of cars, people use public transport more rarely. Everyone prefers to have his/her own car, so the future of public transport is very dark.

How can I be here at D\u2019el Arte  wearing a suit and tie with my beautiful wife?   The day hadn\u2019t been planned to end with a date night.  Then it all dawned on me.  I\u2019d been set up.  Duped, so to speak, into this unlikely event; a date night.  Her plan was so clever and deceptive as to escape detection until the last card had been played.  \nOh, my wife is clever.  When exactly did the deception begin?  Was it at the party which lasted until 3am the night before? Was it  the invitation to a wedding three weeks ago?  How far back could it possibly go?  When was this seed planted in my wife\u2019s brain to have a date night with me all dressed up and formal? \nSo many twists and turns. She played her cards well. I never suspected, while sitting in the pews next to my wife, that, when she leaned forward with a pained expression on her face,  the evening would end at D\u2019el Arte.  Nor when her condition appeared to worsen and I decided to go get the car to take her to the doctor\u2019s surgery. Nor when I returned to find her lying on the cold hard stone floor of the church, could I have ever imagined we would be enjoying a quiet evening together sharing entrees and desserts.  Nor could I have conceived, after having multiple people help call the ambulance, which never came, or the friends who called my in-laws to come take care of the kids, that we would be eating a wonderful pizza by the end of the evening.  No, none of these things would have prepared me for the relief I would feel, after waiting 4 hours in the emergency room, that her pains were probably only intercostal muscle pains and the tests for something more serious were all negative.\nHonestly dear, next time just ask me.  I\u2019ll say yes.\n", "Due to the ever-increasing population coupled with climate change, food shortages have become a significant problem facing many countries. Some assert that genetically modified food technology could be applied to address this problem. This essay will argue that genetically modified food could be the way out of the problem of food deficit and this will be done by focusing on its environmental benefits and increased food yield.\n\nFirstly, GM food can have a positive impact on the problem of food safety. It is well known that GM food is <unk> with various resistance genes, such as pest disease resistance genes. This means that the food, being more resistant to pests and agricultural diseases, we can minimise the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers that can poison the water supply and pollute the environment. This reduction in the application of chemical products can create a safer agricultural environment, ensuring food safety.\n\nFurthermore, GM food can also improve the production of crops. Due to the various new traits resulting from the GM technology, such as drought tolerance and salinity tolerance, GM food can ensure food production in a period of drought. This could be important for food production, especially in developing countries. However, some may argue that it is also questionable whether GM food has a detrimental impact on human health. Actually, thousands of tests on GM food, before bringing it onto the markets, have proven that it is harmless to both the environment and human health.\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that GM food can increase food yields with a reduced use of chemicals. In view of this, it is reasonable to believe that GM food might be an ideal strategy to alleviate the problem of food shortages. However, because there are some disadvantages to the GM technology which is being developed, it is also recommended that governments should give more importance to the management of GM food.", "Hello Jane!\n\nHere is a picture from  last summer when we were in Halland on an island called Nidingen!\n\nMy name is Lorin and I am 13 years old. I live in Djursholm at Riddarv\u00e4gen 42, close to a field. I was born on August 4 at the hospital in Danderyd. In my family there are five people; my mom Malak, my dad Claes, my little sister Novalie and my little brother Edvard. Novalie is 10 years old and Edvard is 6 years old. In my spare time I like to be with friends and I do also play soccer, dance and ski. I really like to do sports because I like to be outside. I compete in skiing and I think it's great fun. I often go skiing in \u00c5re, Vemdalen and in Ramundberget. Once every year, I ski with my ski club (T\u00e4by slalomklubb) in Switzerland. In Switzerland we have been to Saas fee and Zermatt. In Zermatt you can see the  Matterhorn (the mountain that you see on Toblerone packaging). It is a very cool mountain. I do also ski with my family and that is the best. I like slalom because it goes fast and I like snow. In the summer holidays, my family and I just spend time on the west coast on a small island called K\u00e5lhuvudet. That is one of our summerhouses. I love to be there because when we are there we swim in the ocean and we fish for crabs and just have a lot of fun. You can, of course, see the ocean and it is very beautiful.\n\nSomething else I like to do is shopping. My parents call me a shopaholic and I almost agree. I like it because it is fun to look at clothes and try them on.\n\nI read quite a lot and my favourite book is Harry Potter. I like fantasy and that book is fantastic. If it was possible to go to Hogwarts I would do it. Now you know what my favourite book is, so you can almost guess what my favorite movie is\u2026 Of course, Harry Potter. But I do also like a movie called The Game Plan. It is about an American football player who doesn't know that he has a daughter and one", "ALL ABOUT ME\n\nMy name is Alexander Engstr\u00f6m. I am 12 years old and I was born on September, 12 2003.\n\nMost of the time I like hanging out and chilling with my friends, but when I am not with my friends, I am home studying. I have one big sister, Anisa. She is 18 years old, and I also have two younger sisters; Alicia, 8 years old and Isabel, 4 years old.\n\nI have many hobbies, but one of my favourite hobbies is skiing downhill, because I love doing it. The reason why I love to ski is the freedom I feel when I ski and it is also my type of sport.\n", "I think that there isn\u00b4t a future for public transport because, nowadays,  people usually use their own private car. This has  some advantages, such as it being more comfortable and faster.\nWhen you travel by bus, you must have a timetable and it is less comfortable than travelling by car, whereas when you go by car you can take your car whenever you want. Sometimes, private transport is  cheaper if you go with other people. For example, when you go by car you can go with other people, so you pay less money for petrol.\nOn the other hand, private transport is damaging for the planet and we must take care of the planet. We can help to prevent the pollution of the environment if we take  public transport,  which doesn't pollute.\nAt the moment, there is more than one car per person. That is a problem for me because people don\u00b4t take care the ofenvironment. They prefer to be comfortable.\nIn conclusion, using public transport causes less damage to the environment <unk>.", "At present, many people think that English is the world language and it is absolutely an essential skill to communicate with people from other countries. For this reason, Taiwanese parents do not want their kids to be behind others. Therefore, many kindergartens have started to teach children English.\n", "Dear Sir,\nI am writing in response to your advertisement on the noticeboard in our language school inviting applications for the post of Club organiser.\nI am a forty-year-old secondary school teacher of Art and I believe I have qualifications that you may be looking for. I have been teaching students for approximately 15 years. I used to run summer camps and art workshops. Working with groups of people fills me with lots of energy and, as they need me, I need them too. I have been studying English for several years and I am preparing to take the FCE exam soon. I enjoy participating in debates. I would describe myself as a good listener and a fluent speaker with a strong ability to control  discussion.\nApart from an ability to get on well with people, I read a lot.

Have you read any good magazine recently? I've just bought a new magazine called Coolclub, which only started a week ago. Inside, there are really great photos and lots of articles about all our favourite  singers and bands.\n\nThere's going to be a competition for a month, with excellent prizes.\n\nThe magazine also has a letters page and they pay $25 for the most interesting letter or email. I think I'll try to write something funny, to win $25. Perhaps I'll describe our journey by boat round the island. Do you remember? You were taking a photo of me and I suddenly fell in the sea! I laughed so much!\n\nWrite and tell me about the magazines you enjoy reading.\n\nWith love from Dimitri.", "House at the End of the Street\n\nThe last movie I watched was House Next Door, a captivating thriller that stars Jennifer Lawrence, Elizabeth Shue and Mark Thieriot. The plot is about a teenage girl who moves in with her mother to their dream house, which was next to a home where a horrible double homicide had taken place. As soon as they move in, they hear the rumors of the incident: a little girl brutally murdered her parents in the middle of the night and disappeared, and the other child of the family recently moved in there.\nAs the movie develops, it has lots of interesting turns that let the viewer draw his/her own conclusions. I myself am a fan of horror movies, which are highly predictable, so it was a great satisfaction to see such a complex film. The end completely blew me away and I believe it was the best part of it. The acting was smooth and credible. \nAlthough it had bad reviews, the movie was well received by the audience; not to mention the fact that Jennifer Lawrence's appearance right after the hit of Hunger Games was great for advertising.\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this film for those who like drama and plot twists.\n\n", "Without a doubt, all parents want their children to be model citizens. However, raising a child into a model citizen is extremely hard work. Some people think that this job should be done by the parents and others think unfairly that this is the teacher's responsibility.\nOn one hand, parents should take responsibility for their children's education as they are a child's first contact. Also, parents are like models to follow for their children, and as children do what they see, they will copy their parents' actions.\nIndeed, school is the first place where a children interacts with society. However, they will talk or build a relationship based on what they see their parents doing with other people. Ultimately, teachers may have different values from those of the parents.\nOn the other hand, parents may have a lack of time to spend with their children due to demanding jobs and to provide everything that their children need, for example, pay for their children's school. It can also be argued that children spend most of their time at school and not at home, making it the school's responsibility to pass on good social values. But it should not be forgotten, that parents have the most influence as they are models to follow.\nTo sum up, parents should take full responsibility for their children's education. However, one should take into account that a school with similar values to those of the parents would be a great help in the child raising process.", "I think all people love sport. In the world, a very famous sports festival is the Olympics. These include many kinds of sports, such as wrestling, basketball, tennis, running, etc.\nMy favourite sports are basketball and martial arts. First, basketball is a team sport, which means I need to understand the expressions of members  of the team and keep in contact them. For example,  my role is cutter but I need to do assister, blocker and guard when I play.\nSecondly, every country has its own martial arts history and culture, for example, kung fu from China, taekwondo from Japan and Karate form Korea. It is not just fighting. These sports give people endurance, speed and power. In particular, I like  karate and Kung-fu. Men and women are <unk> it. There is no special criteria, such as tall and strong muscles or gender. These 2 sports improve basic human ability to reach the highest capability possible.\nI suggest to other people to first understand yourself, such as what you like, what is possible, and then practice after every success.
